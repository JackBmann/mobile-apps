Perhaps the most famous is Thomas Jefferson Rusk, judge, statesman and Sam Houston's secretary of war. Like Rusk, Charles Stanfield Taylor, John S.

Hamilton, veterans of the Battle of San Jacinto; Jacob Lewis; James Harper Starr; General Kelsey H. Douglass; George F. Ingraham; Nicholas Adolphus Sterne; Captain Frederick Voigt; and Dr. Robert A. Irion, who also was Sam Houston's personal physician. Other burials of interest include those of former slaves Mitchell Thorn, Lawrence Sleet and Eliza Walker. Frost Thorn was among Texas' early millionaires; Deidrich Anton Wilhelm Rulfs, Nacogdoches' master architect, designed Zion Hill Baptist Church on the north side of the cemetery.

The federal program provided employment for 2.5 million young men working out of 3,000 camps. Roughly 50,000 Texans were enrolled in the ccc and made a significant contribution to the development of the state’s park system. The colorful frontier history of fort griffin and the need for its preservation prompted citizens of shackelford county to donate the historic site to the state. The national park service approved a new ccc camp at fort griffin state park in 1939. Crews from existing camps in cleburne and lockhart arrived in 1939 and 1940. In the spring of 1940, as original company members were discharged, local area men signed up and were assigned to fort griffin. Many of these men enrolled in classes at the camp and local high school, and participated in local sports and activities. Around 200 men completed a stone pavilion, park roads, 24 table and bench combinations, 14 camp fire places, two latrines, surveys of the park, a water drainage system and entrance gate, and planted trees and shrubs on hundreds of acres. Although some local groups hoped that the focus would be on the restoration of historical features, most of the work completed at the time was on recreational amenities. The rock gate, roads, fort ruins and pavilion remain at the site. The camp was abandoned on dec. 1, 1941. Many of the young men went straight into military service and wwii. In the 1940s, many buildings used by the ccc were moved to military camps or schools throughout texas.

          <value>The civilian conservation corps (ccc) operated nationwide between 1933 and 1942 to conserve natural resources and to provide work for young men during the great depression. The federal program provided employment for 2.5 million young men working out of 3,000 camps. Roughly 50,000 Texans were enrolled in the ccc and made a significant contribution to the development of the state’s park system. The colorful frontier history of fort griffin and the need for its preservation prompted citizens of shackelford county to donate the historic site to the state. The national park service approved a new ccc camp at fort griffin state park in 1939. Crews from existing camps in cleburne and lockhart arrived in 1939 and 1940. In the spring of 1940, as original company members were discharged, local area men signed up and were assigned to fort griffin. Many of these men enrolled in classes at the camp and local high school, and participated in local sports and activities. Around 200 men completed a stone pavilion, park roads, 24 table and bench combinations, 14 camp fire places, two latrines, surveys of the park, a water drainage system and entrance gate, and planted trees and shrubs on hundreds of acres. Although some local groups hoped that the focus would be on the restoration of historical features, most of the work completed at the time was on recreational amenities. The rock gate, roads, fort ruins and pavilion remain at the site. The camp was abandoned on dec. 1, 1941. Many of the young men went straight into military service and wwii. In the 1940s, many buildings used by the ccc were moved to military camps or schools throughout texas. Image source: legendsofamerica.com</value>

In 1864 the committee on religious conditions of the colored population recommended to the churches of the Austin Baptist Association that separate services be provided for their black members. Soon after, slaves in the First Baptist Congregation began attending special wrship services conducted by a white missionary and a slave preacher, the Rev Jacob Fontaine, a prominent black leader of the city. In 1867, under the direction of the Rev. Fontaine, the First Baptist Church was formally organized with thirteen charter members. Early services for the new congregation were held in a blacksmith shop at the southwest corner of tenth and congress, and in the basement of the First Baptist Church. In 1869, during the administration of Mayor Leader Brown, the city of Austin deeded the church a tract of land at the corner of ninth and Guadalupe for construction of the first sanctuary. A significant force in the development of Austin’s black community since the 1860s, the church has been led by many prominent Baptist preachers. (1981).

          <value>The oldest Black Baptist church in the city, this fellowship grew from the slave membership of the First Baptist Church of Austin. In 1864 the committee on religious conditions of the colored population recommended to the churches of the Austin Baptist Association that separate services be provided for their black members. Soon after, slaves in the First Baptist Congregation began attending special wrship services conducted by a white missionary and a slave preacher, the Rev Jacob Fontaine, a prominent black leader of the city. In 1867, under the direction of the Rev. Fontaine, the First Baptist Church was formally organized with thirteen charter members. Early services for the new congregation were held in a blacksmith shop at the southwest corner of tenth and congress, and in the basement of the First Baptist Church. In 1869, during the administration of Mayor Leader Brown, the city of Austin deeded the church a tract of land at the corner of ninth and Guadalupe for construction of the first sanctuary. A significant force in the development of Austin’s black community since the 1860s, the church has been led by many prominent Baptist preachers. (1981). Image source: txhillcountrytrail.com</value>

In an effort to address this issue, Austin civic leaders urged the city, through its “Negro War Recreation Council,” to provide recreational sites for servicemen on leave from military posts. One such project, a gymnasium-auditorium complex in Rosewood Park, opened in April 1944 and was dedicated to Doris Miller, an African American Pearl Harbor hero. By war’s end, African American servicemen had added but limited “R&R” sites in Austin. Johnny Holmes responded to this need when he opened the original Victory Grill (a.k.a. Victory Cafe) in celebration of VJ Day (Victory over Japan Day, August 15, 1945) in a converted icehouse on East 11th Street. Holmes created a venue in East Austin which provided returning African American servicemen with both an accessible dining establishment and blues and jazz entertainment. In 1947, with support from his devoted wife, Basyle Winifred Vanzandt, Holmes built a new structure at 1104 E. 11th Street to house the new Victory Grill. The enclosed open-air patio in the rear, dubbed the Kovac Room, became a well-known stop on the “Chitlin’ Circuit,” a collection of African American music venues across the west and south. The relatively small capacity of the Kovac Room and desegregation in the 1960s eventually led to the decline of the Victory Grill as African American musicians found new venues across the nation where they could perform, and the Victory Grill closed in 1973. Following Holmes’ death in 2001, his children succeeded in re-opening the beloved site. Johnny Holmes was extremely passionate about the Victory Grill being of service to the community and its patrons, and he took a special interest in making soldiers feel at home. Listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1998, the Victory Grill is a home front cultural landmark of the World War II African American experience.

The church survived several natural disasters, beginning in 1875, when the sanctuary was damaged in a storm. It was destroyed in 1885 by a fire that burned a large area of the city.

More than 30 ministers have served this congregation, including the Rev. J. E. Edwards, the Rev. Josiah Armstrong, the Rev. M. D. Moody, the Rev. W. R. Beamer, the Rev. Louis H. Reynolds, the Rev. A. I. Henley, the Rev. R. C. Walker, the Rev. Erford Barker, the Rev. C. B. Bryant, and the current (1975) pastor, the Rev. Sylvester L. Green. Many of Galveston's prominent black citizens have been members of Reedy Chapel A. M. E. Church. Today the fellowship includes several descendants of the original founders.
