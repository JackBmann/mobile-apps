The leader of the 1826 Fredonian Rebellion, Edwards is interred here. The earliest marked burial on this site is that of Franklin J. Starr (d. 1837), a native of New Hartford, Connecticut and a local realtor. Many graves from the early Spanish cemetery of Nacogdoches were relocated to this site when the county courthouse was erected on the Spanish cemetery grounds in 1912. The earliest grave from that burial ground is marked, "Father Mendoza," 1718. Oak Grove Cemetery is filled with historical figures important both to Nacogdoches County and the State of Texas. Perhaps the most famous is Thomas Jefferson Rusk, judge, statesman and Sam Houston's secretary of war. Like Rusk, Charles Stanfield Taylor, John S. Roberts and William Clark , Jr., signed the Texas Declaration of Independence. Other statesmen and soldiers interred here include Captain Haden Arnold and Elias E. Hamilton, veterans of the Battle of San Jacinto; Jacob Lewis; James Harper Starr; General Kelsey H. Douglass; George F. Ingraham; Nicholas Adolphus Sterne; Captain Frederick Voigt; and Dr. Robert A. Irion, who also was Sam Houston's personal physician. Other burials of interest include those of former slaves Mitchell Thorn, Lawrence Sleet and Eliza Walker. Frost Thorn was among Texas' early millionaires; Deidrich Anton Wilhelm Rulfs, Nacogdoches' master architect, designed Zion Hill Baptist Church on the north side of the cemetery. Richard William Haltom founded and edited Nacogdoches' "The Daily Sentinel," and poet Karle Wilson Baker was the third person named a fellow to the Texas Institute of Letters. (2000).

The federal program provided employment for 2.5 million young men working out of 3,000 camps. Roughly 50,000 Texans were enrolled in the ccc and made a significant contribution to the development of the state’s park system. The colorful frontier history of fort griffin and the need for its preservation prompted citizens of shackelford county to donate the historic site to the state. The national park service approved a new ccc camp at fort griffin state park in 1939. Crews from existing camps in cleburne and lockhart arrived in 1939 and 1940. In the spring of 1940, as original company members were discharged, local area men signed up and were assigned to fort griffin. Many of these men enrolled in classes at the camp and local high school, and participated in local sports and activities. Around 200 men completed a stone pavilion, park roads, 24 table and bench combinations, 14 camp fire places, two latrines, surveys of the park, a water drainage system and entrance gate, and planted trees and shrubs on hundreds of acres. Although some local groups hoped that the focus would be on the restoration of historical features, most of the work completed at the time was on recreational amenities. The rock gate, roads, fort ruins and pavilion remain at the site. The camp was abandoned on dec. 1, 1941. Many of the young men went straight into military service and wwii. In the 1940s, many buildings used by the ccc were moved to military camps or schools throughout texas.

Settled in 1871 when Charles Clark, a freedman, bought two acres of land on present Tenth Street. This formed the nucleus of the community that Clark, according to tradition, wanted to start for his people. For years Clarksville lay in a wilderness on the outskirts of Austin, crossed only by a few country roads. Gradually it grew into a closely knit village, with activities centering on the Sweet Home Baptist Church. At first members met in the home of Mrs. Mary Smith. Then, in 1882, they purchased this site. Religious fervor was strong in those days, and the residents often stood on their porches at dawn to begin the day with a hymn. The first church building was erected in the 1880s; present (fourth) one in 1935. Among Clarksville's distinguished citizens was Elias Mayes, who served in the Texas Legislature in 1879 and 1889. One of the first ministers of Sweet Home, The Rev. Jacob Fontaine, was instrumental in unifying Negro Baptist churches in Austin and started the first Negro newspaper, "The Gold Dollar," in the city. As of 1973, Clarksville encompassed over 9 square blocks, bounded by Tenth, West Lynn, and Waterston streets and the Missouri-Pacific Railroad tracks. (1973).

            <value><![CDATA[Historic Black neighborhood. Settled in 1871 when Charles Clark, a freedman, bought two acres of land on present Tenth Street. This formed the nucleus of the community that Clark, according to tradition, wanted to start for his people. For years Clarksville lay in a wilderness on the outskirts of Austin, crossed only by a few country roads. Gradually it grew into a closely knit village, with activities centering on the Sweet Home Baptist Church. At first members met in the home of Mrs. Mary Smith. Then, in 1882, they purchased this site. Religious fervor was strong in those days, and the residents often stood on their porches at dawn to begin the day with a hymn. The first church building was erected in the 1880s; present (fourth) one in 1935. Among Clarksville's distinguished citizens was Elias Mayes, who served in the Texas Legislature in 1879 and 1889. One of the first ministers of Sweet Home, The Rev. Jacob Fontaine, was instrumental in unifying Negro Baptist churches in Austin and started the first Negro newspaper, "The Gold Dollar," in the city. As of 1973, Clarksville encompassed over 9 square blocks, bounded by Tenth, West Lynn, and Waterston streets and the Missouri-Pacific Railroad tracks. (1973). Image source: sweethomebc.org]]></value>

In an effort to address this issue, Austin civic leaders urged the city, through its “Negro War Recreation Council,” to provide recreational sites for servicemen on leave from military posts. One such project, a gymnasium-auditorium complex in Rosewood Park, opened in April 1944 and was dedicated to Doris Miller, an African American Pearl Harbor hero. By war’s end, African American servicemen had added but limited “R&R” sites in Austin. Johnny Holmes responded to this need when he opened the original Victory Grill (a.k.a. Victory Cafe) in celebration of VJ Day (Victory over Japan Day, August 15, 1945) in a converted icehouse on East 11th Street. Holmes created a venue in East Austin which provided returning African American servicemen with both an accessible dining establishment and blues and jazz entertainment. In 1947, with support from his devoted wife, Basyle Winifred Vanzandt, Holmes built a new structure at 1104 E. 11th Street to house the new Victory Grill. The enclosed open-air patio in the rear, dubbed the Kovac Room, became a well-known stop on the “Chitlin’ Circuit,” a collection of African American music venues across the west and south. The relatively small capacity of the Kovac Room and desegregation in the 1960s eventually led to the decline of the Victory Grill as African American musicians found new venues across the nation where they could perform, and the Victory Grill closed in 1973. Following Holmes’ death in 2001, his children succeeded in re-opening the beloved site. Johnny Holmes was extremely passionate about the Victory Grill being of service to the community and its patrons, and he took a special interest in making soldiers feel at home. Listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1998, the Victory Grill is a home front cultural landmark of the World War II African American experience.

A post office was established in 1846 for Webber's Prairie, and by 1853 the name was changed to Webberville. Based on a cotton farming economy, the town later included grist mills, cotton mills, general stores, schools, churches, and a cemetery. The post office was discontinued in 1903. A ferry crossing on the Colorado River ceased operation in the 1920s. (1997)]]></value>

Webber, who along with his African American wife and children, settled in this sparsely populated area of Texas in 1839 to escape the racism they had experienced in towns and cities. A community known as Webber Prairie consisting of plantation owners and their slaves developed here. Racial prejudice caused Webber to sell his land to Colonel John Banks in 1851 and move his family to Mexico. In 1868 Matthew Duty donated one acre of land here for the purpose of building a church for the area's recently emancipated African Americans. That year the Webberville Ebenezer Baptist Church was organized as a mission of the St. John Regular Missionary Baptist Association. Charter members included Thomas Reads, Suns Johnson, Lowens Berry, and Mary Green. The Rev. Wesley Barrow served as Ebenezer's first pastor. In 1956 several members of the congregation left Ebenezer Baptist to form a church in Austin which became known as the New Light Ebenezer Baptist Church. Ebenezer Baptist remains active despite the relocation of many of Webberville's families to nearby urban centers. Former members continue to gather here on special occasions and holidays.

            <value>On January 15, 1942, the u.s. army established a tank destroyer tactical and firing center near killeen covering more than 100 square miles. Camp hood (later fort hood) would be used to train fifty battalions of about 1,000 men each for world war ii combat. Because of the size of the facility, the army needed to acquire more than 88,000 acres of land. About twenty small communities in coryell county were taken by the government for the establishment of the facility, later named fort hood. Many communities were established in the early 1850s before the county was created. During the time of the property acquisitions there was much confusion among the citizens of coryell county. Families who had lived on the same land for generations watched as homes and churches were lost and beloved dead were reburied in other cemeteries. Financial difficulties arose because of the chaos that followed. The changes happened in a matter of days and weeks because of the urgent need for military training and response. It was a long and hard recovery for those uprooted. In an article in the gatesville messenger on february 27, 1942, the author speaks about committee representatives of the camp site area appealing to elected officials about the land prices. The people affected by fort hood did not oppose the government using their land for its purpose, but they did expect to be paid reasonable prices so that they might purchase similar homes in other places. Because of the common hardships, community members banded together and became a closer group. Today, even though they are more scattered geographically, these families and their descendants maintain connections through communication, reunions and the traditions of generations past.

            <value><![CDATA[This congregation was organized in February 1873, though Catholic worship services had been held in area homes by visiting clergy for several years. Primary members of the congregation were German and Irish immigrants. The land on which the church was built was given by David and Lucy Doole in 1881, though the structure had been completed in 1876. Local carpenters and stonemasons provided construction labor. The building has undergone several renovations over the years, including recent additions. St. Joseph's Church has served the community for generations. Texas Sesquicentennial 1836-1986.

            <value>Camp Mabry was established in 1892 as the site for annual encampments of Texas Volunteer Guard. The original 85 acres were a gift of the people of Austin. During the formative years, Guardsmen staged “sham battles” as part of their training, sold tickets and the proceeds were used to add to the site of the camp. At its largest, Camp Mabry consisted of 430,868 acres. It was named by vote of Guardsmen in honor of Adjutant General W H. Mabry who died in Cuba during the Spanish American War. Camp Mabry was a major staging area for that war. In 1914 the State built an arsenal here ad State military stores were moved here from the already crowded Capitol. During World War I it was used by the U.S. Army, an during World War II it was used as an intelligence school by the Air Corps. The post was used as a principal site for the Guard’s annual encampments until 1928. The office of the State Adjutant General was moved here from the Capitol in 1954. The Department of Public Safety used facilities here for training Highway Patrolmen and the Texas Rangers were trained and headquartered here until 1953. The Texas Army National Guard s=State Officer Candidate School was established in 1959. Other activities at Camp Mabry include the U.S. Property and Fiscal Office and warehouses plus other major headquarters of the Texas National Guard. Image source: militarybases.com</value>

The mission's principal secular activity was cattle ranching, largely developed at this site. After the mission relocated to present Goliad County in 1749, its ranching operation grew to an estimated 40,000 head of cattle and was influential in the development of the famed Texas longhorn breed. In 1833, Felix de Leon received a Spanish land grant that included the former Espiritu Santo property in Victoria County. Abner McDonald purchased the land at a public auction in 1841, and sold it to J. O. Wheeler in 1850. Quincy Davidson purchased the property in 1867. The 1870 census listed Davidson as the wealthiest landowner in Victoria County, and by 1878 the "Victoria Advocate" reported that he owned 59,989 of the 61,161 head of cattle then in Victoria County. The Davidson family retained ownership of the land for 97 years, gradually selling off large tracts. Much of the area surrounding the present ranch property remains known as the Davidson lands.

The city continued to use the building, known by the 1920s as the Houston Public Library, until 1926, when the new library building opened at this site. Ideson and the library building committee worked throughout the 1920s to formulate a plan and program for the new structure, visiting other U.S. cities and accepting proposals from several noted architects. They chose Ralph Adams Cram and his Boston firm, Cram and Ferguson, for the project. Cram worked with local architects William Ward Watkin and Louis A. Glover, coordinating also with the city's architect, W.A. Dowdy. The Southwestern Construction Company served as the builder. Noted for his design work throughout the Northeast, Cram chose the Spanish Renaissance Revival style for Houston's library. Details include tile roof, arched openings, cast stone window surrounds, finials lining the parapet wall, and ornate metalwork. The L-shaped building's materials are primarily brick, cast stone and limestone. After more than 40 years as Houston's librarian, Ideson died in 1945. The city renamed the library six years later to honor her contributions to Houston's library program, as well as her involvement in numerous civic groups and professional associations.

Carbajal, son-in-law of De Leon. Carbajal's survey expanded on the founder's basic design for the city, which followed the style of traditional Spanish municipalities. A water well lined with brick was placed in the center of the square in 1850. By 1872 a windmill stood over the well; twelve years later it was replaced by a standpipe. Other improvements included a bandstand in the 1870s, hitching racks in 1897; a Confederate memorial status, "Last Stand" by Pompeo Coppini, dedicated in 1912; and lamp standards in 1923. In that year the standpipe was removed and the bandstand was relocated to the center of the plaza. Sidewalks were added by the Public Works Administration in the 1930s. Through the efforts of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, the site was renamed De Leon Plaza as part of a plaza beautification project in 1941. As a gathering place, summer concert arena, exposition site, and town center, De Leon Plaza continues to serve the people of Victoria as it has for generations.

His most visible contribution to the growing community, however, was the ten-story Hotel Paso Del Norte, which was completed in 1912.

A central, diamond-shaped park was the terminus for an electric trolley which ran into the central business district.

Railroad lines reached Del Rio in 1884, furthering growth. Brown Plaza, dedicated on Cinco De Mayo, 1908, was gathering place for the community. A bandstand (or Kiosko) was built by the people. Musical concerts delighted audiences and performers. The Plaza was scene of political and social gatherings. Formal promenades became a custom. Travelers rested here and cooked thier food over charcoal fires. George Washington Brown (1836-1918), donor of the Plaza, was born in North Carolina, migrating West in his youth. He served his adopted state for 43 years in offices of county clerk and district clerk. The Plaza was restored in 1969. (1970). Image source: texastimetravel.com]]></value>

marker text: This land had once been allocated in the 1700s as a ranch for Mission San Jose in San Antonio (20 mi. N), but in the 1820s was left unsettled. In 1828 prominent San Antonio resident Jose Antonio Navarro (1795-1871) beseeched the Governor of the Mexican state to grant him four leagues of land for pasture. Navarro officially received his grant for this land on the Atascosa River in 1831, though he might have occupied the ranch earlier.
 In 1836, Navarro signed the Texas Declaration of Independence, and in the following years was occupied by business and politics elsewhere. By 1853 he had concentrated his ranching interests here and spent the summers in a log house overlooking the Atascosa River. He registered his cattle brand in Atascosa County in 1856, and donated land for a county seat in 1857, though the seat was moved to Pleasanton in 1858.
 The 1860 census listed 400 cattle, 200 swine, 35 horses, and 12 oxen on the ranch of almost 18,000 acres. Oil was noted on this land as early as 1867. Navarro turned the ranch over to his sons after the Civil War, and following his death in 1871 in San Antonio, the land was divided among his five children. This acreage remained in the family until his son Sixto Eusebio Navarro (b.1833) sold the old ranch home in 1894. (1986)

            <value><![CDATA["Father of Brownwood"  (1807-1888)   Donor of present townsite of Brownwood, Fisk was noted as a soldier, public servant, surveyor, and businessman.  The son of English parents, he was born in New York.  As a boy he was so studious that he voluntarily gave up recess periods to read.  In 1834 he abandoned his preparation for the Presbyterian ministry and, with a friend, embarked down the Ohio River on a skiff to brave the Texas frontier.  Settling at Mina (present Bastrop), he fought in the Battle of San Jacinto in 1836.  He later served in various county offices in Bastrop and Williamson counties and was a senator in the Republic of Texas.  As a government surveyor in this period, he mapped this region and liked it so well he determined to settle here.  Having received in 1846, for his service in the Texas Revolution, a large land grant in this vicinity, he moved here in 1860.  Besides teaching, he also served as county judge and in other offices.  When difficulties arose over the location of the county seat, he donated 60 acres for the town and 100 acres for county purposes.  He then persuaded many citizens to move here from the old townsite.  At his death in 1888, Fisk was buried in Greenleaf Cemetery. (1968)]]></value>

One of those efforts was the establishment of the Central National Road, designed to connect the Red River to existing military roads along the Trinity River and points farther west, thus opening much of northeast Texas to both settlement and commerce. On February 5, 1844, the Congress created a five-man commission to supervise the surveying and construction of the road. Commission members, which included John Yeary, received land for their work. Yeary selected property in present Collin County and founded a settlement that grew to become Farmersville.<br>  The commissioners chose George Stell of Paris, Texas, as surveyor for the project. He began his work in April 1844 from a point now within the city of Dallas. He and his assistant traveled northeast, measuring and marking the exact route, which passed through the present counties of Dallas, Rockwall, Collin, Hunt, Fannin, Lamar and Red River; only three of them had been formally organized at that time. The new route utilized existing prairies and natural stream crossings, and avoided obstacles like densely wooded areas. It ended at the Kiomatia Crossing of the Red River near present Jonesborough, Red River County.<br>  While records are unclear as to whether construction was ever completed, history shows the Central National Road was short-lived, soon replaced by the Preston Road and other early routes, and eventually by rail lines. It did, however, help open northeast Texas to increased growth and development.

The Galveston "News" began publication and the first federal court in Texas was established. The city was soon to become the most important cultural and commercial center in the state.
    In 1858, trackage of the Galveston, Houston and Henderson Railroad was completed between the Island and Houston. By July, 1861, the Federal blockade was extended to Texas. Confederate forces evacuated Galveston in October, 1862, but in 1863, with General John Bankhead Magruder in command, the Confederate forces occupied the city, capturing four vessels and some 300 Federal troops. The Confederate forces remained here until the end of the Civil War.]]></value>

When the colonists refused to deliver the cannon, Ugartechea sent 150  Dragoons to demand the weapon.  Alcalde Andrew Ponton, in the meantime, sent word to other colonists that he had refused to surrender the cannon, which on September 29 was buried in George W. Davis' peach orchard.

Juan N. Seguin and his father in 1834 rallied fellow Texans against dictator Santa Anna.  Young Juan Seguin raised Mexican-Texan troops, and fought in Siege of Bexar, 1835.  He provided horses for soldiers of Col. W. B. Travis, further aiding as a courier during the Siege of the Alamo.  Between fall of the Alamo and the Battle of San Jacinto, he led his Co. A,  2nd Regiment, Texas Cavalry, as rear guard for Gen. Sam Houston, protecting the civilians fleeing in front of army of Santa Anna.  His men and Moseley Baker's troops held San Felipe, preventing Mexican Army from crossing the Brazos there.  Then Seguin's unit joined Gen. Sam Houston's army and fought in the Battle of San Jacinto.  In May 1836, Seguin gave military burial to the ashes of the heroes of the Alamo.

In 1829, the authorities at San Felipe de Austin requested that Lynch move his ferry service, which had been running from Crystal Bay, upstream to a peninsula formed by a meander of the San Jacinto River. He satisfied the requirements in 1830, moving to an area near the present landing. Lynch passed away in 1837, but his family continued to operate the ferry service until 1848.<br> Between 1848 and 1888, various operators bought and ran the service. During this time, Lynchburg experienced many changes. A fire in 1874 and a series of storms dating from the late 1800s to the early 20th century devastated the town and hastened its decline.<br> In 1888, Harris County purchased the ferry and in 1920 put the diesel-powered, cable-free Chester H. Bryan boat into service. They added the Tex Dreyfus in 1945. The two boats were replaced in 1964 by the William P. Hobby and the Ross S. Sterling, which have served the area for a number of years.<br> By the 1950s, business returned to Lynchburg; a shipyard, marine service companies and the Coastal Water Authority all opened in following years.

After Sam Houston expressed disapproval of the poorly-organized venture, many recruits left the expedition before it reached the settlement of San Patricio along the Nueces River in January 1836.  Mexican general Santa Anna, who was organizing an army to attack Texan forces at the Alamo in San Antonio, discovered the Matamoros plan and dispatched General Jose Urrea to stop the advancing expedition.

In 1828, John McMullen and James McGloin received a land grant from the Mexican government for an Irish colony north of the river and founded the town of San Patricio.  This site soon became a major crossing on the Matamoros Road into Texas.  To protect the crossing, the Mexican army, in 1831, established nearby Fort Lipantitlan, which was captured November 4, 1835, by insurgent Texans.  On Feb. 27, 1836, Gen. Jose Urrea's Army defeated the Texan forces of James Grant and F.W. Johnson here before marching to Goliad.  After Texas won independence, Gen. Vicente Filisola led the defeated Mexican troops back to Mexico along this road.  After crossing the river here in summer of 1845, Gen. Zachary Taylor held his army in this region until March 1846, when he moved to the Rio Grande, the action which precipitated the U.S. War with Mexico (1846-48).

marker text:   General Jose Urrea, Governor of his native state of Durango, Mexico, was dispatched northeastward early in 1836 by Dictator Antonio Lopez De Sana Anna, to fight against the Texas Colonists in their uprising for independence. Because of his superior numbers, he won easy victories at and near the town of San Patricio (about 40 miles southwest of here).
  When he reached mission Nuestra Senora Del Refugio, his troops (comprised mainly of non-Spanish-speaking Yucatanians who had been pressed into fighting by Santa Anna) met heavy resistance form the Refugio townsmen, and Urrea lost many men in action.
  Later, the Texas volunteers under Captain Amon B. King and Lieutenant Colonel William Ward left the Mission, and Urrea was Victorious.  After his men looted the town of Refugio, Urrea had them drag their dead into a four-foot by four-foot ditch which a colonist named Poland had used as a fence around his town lot.  Eyewitness Sabina Brown said that the dead made a stack as large as twenty cords of wood.  When the ditch was filled, it became the common grave of these Yucatanians.</value>

The general council of the provisional government of Texas had instructed Francis W. Johnson and Dr. James Grant to lead an independent military force against Matamoros, Mexico.  Although many of the troops left the command to follow Sam Houston, who opposed the expedition, about 60-70 men remained.  Mexican general Jose Urrea, who learned of the plan from his network of spies, sent word to San Patricio settlers loyal to Mexico, instructing them to leave a light burning in their homes as a signal to Mexican troops to spare them.  After attacking a small force at Garza's Ranch (4 miles south), the Mexicans struck San Patricio, killing 16 and taking 30 prisoners.  Johnson, working late with a candle burning, and four others in his house escaped.  The Mexican troops then proceeded to Agua Dulce Creek (about 20 miles south) and attacked the remaining Texan forces under Grant's command on March 2.  Grant and 11 others were killed, seven were captured, and six escaped.

            <value><![CDATA[Margaret Moffette Lea Houston (April 11, 1819-December 3, 1867) Margaret Moffette Lea was born on her family's farm in Pleasant Valley, near Marion, Alabama. She graduated from Judson Female Institute in Marion in 1837, and in 1839 she met General Sam Houston. Houston, who had completed his term as the first President of the Republic of Texas, was visiting Alabama for business ventures. Despite their 26-year age difference, the two married in 1840. During their marriage, Margaret was successful in curbing the General's use of alcohol and in encouraging him to become a dedicated church member. The Houstons owned residences in Houston City and in Cedar Point. In 1841, Gen. Houston was elected to his second term as President of the Republic of Texas. For the first time, Texas had a First Lady, as Margaret joined her husband at the temporary capital of Washington-on-the-Brazos. During the presidency, the couple had the first of their eight children. After the term, the Houston family moved to a plantation they named Raven Hill (14 mi. E). While her husband later served as a U.S Senator, Margaret Houston managed the plantation and participated in church, social and literary activities. She also underwent surgery and treatment for breast cancer. The family later lived in Huntsville at their Woodland home and in Independence. Margaret Houston continued to raise her family and, when General Houston became Governor, again served as First Lady. The couple later moved to the Steamboat House in Huntsville. After her husband died in 1863, Margaret Houston returned to Independence, where she provided for her children until her death from yellow fever in 1867. Today, Margaret Moffette Lea Houston is remembered as a First Lady and the matriarch of one of the most significant families in Texas history. (2008)]]></value>

Its location on the West Bernard River was strategic in protecting Houston, then capital of Texas, from possible invasion by Mexico.  Cannons, rifles, muskets, powder, and shot were stored at the station.  Troops under Lt. H. L. Grush and later Capt. Martin K. Snell maintained the post despite harsh living conditions.

Many immigrated to the U.S., establishing communities in New York City and elsewhere along the east coast. Overcrowding in these neighborhoods coincided with growing anti-Semitic sentiment. The Galveston movement, a humanitarian effort that brought nearly 10,000 Jewish immigrants through the Port of Galveston between 1907 and 1914, was initiated to address these issues by dispersing Jews throughout the U.S.<br> Jacob Schiff, a banker and philanthropist, championed the idea of bringing Jews to the south. He was the sole donor of the plan, pledging $500,000. Galveston was chosen because its railroads and relatively small size would encourage immigrants to move elsewhere. It was also home to Rabbi Henry Cohen, leader of the local reform synagogue B’Nai Israel, and a small but thriving Jewish community.<br> The first ship to arrive under the plan was the S.S. Cassel, on July 1, 1907, from Bremen, Germany; 86 of the passengers were Jewish. Cohen welcomed the new immigrants, as he would every group that came during the program. The arrivals were processed at the Jewish Immigrants’ Information Bureau (JIIB) Headquarters. JIIB workers informed them of communities needing workers of varying skills and gave the immigrants railroad tickets and rations. More than 150 towns requested that the JIIB send skilled workers. In 1914, the program ended when the JIIB office in Galveston closed. A total of 9,332 Jews came through Galveston. While the number of Jews living in the American Midwest, South and West has never matched the numbers living in the East, the program brought thousands of Jews to places they had never imagined.

The program sought to teach these children a vocabulary of 400 essential words to enable them to successfully complete the first grade. Isabel Verver, a 17-year-old Ganado High School student, read an article in a Spring 1957 issue of Texas Outlook Magazine that expressed Felix Tijerina's desire for such a program. Tijerina was a successful Houston businessman as well as the national president of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC). Verver contacted Tijerina and expressed her desire to implement such a program. Both Tijerina and Verver knew what it was like to be a first-grader unable to communicate with their teachers or fellow students, and hoped to remove that language barrier. Baytown educator Elizabeth Burrus supplied a list of 400 vocabulary words to Tijerina that she had formulated from years of teaching bilingual students. Verver taught the pilot class in Ganado during the summer of 1957 and produced 60 "graduates" in time for the fall school term. Seeing Verver's success, LULAC established similar classes in towns such as Vanderbilt, Edna, Sugar Land, Aldine, Brookshire and Wharton for summer 1958. Tijerina and members of LULAC worked for passage of House Bill 51 during the 56th Texas Legislature. The bill established a state-sponsored program called preschool instructional classes for non-English speaking children and eliminated the need for the privately funded "Little Schools." Head Start and other federally-funded programs of the 1960s eventually took the place of the state-sponsored program.

The son of Rev. Andrew and Evaline Foster, he finished eighth grade in Calvert and pitched for the Waco Yellow Jackets and Fort Worth Colts from 1897 to 1902. Renowned for his fastball and screwball, he became a dominant pitcher on Midwest and Northeast Championship teams, first with Frank Leland’s Chicago Union Giants and later on teams in Philadelphia, New York City, and Otsego, Michigan. Records show that he won more than fifty games in 1903 with the Cuban X Giants and in 1905 with the Philadelphia Giants. Foster wrote “How to Pitch” in Sol White’s Official Base Ball Guide: History of Colored Base Ball in 1907. His nickname “Rube” came from a Great White pitcher of the day, G. E. “Rube” Waddell, whom Foster beat in an exhibition game. Foster became playing manager of the Leland Giants in 1907. Under his leadership, the team won 48 straight games and finished with a 110-10 record. His teams were known for successful bunting, base stealing, and hit and runs. In 1910, Foster organized his own team of all-stars and compiled a 128-6 record. His Chicago American Giants were a dynasty, winning eleven championships from 1911-22.<br> In 1920, Foster and owners of seven other clubs met in Kansas City, Missouri to form the first successful African-American professional baseball circuit; Foster was elected president. His American Giants won the Negro National League’s first three pennants. In 1926, Foster was admitted to Kankakee State Hospital in Illinois, where he stayed for four years before his death. Thousands of mourners attended his funeral in Chicago. Foster, the “Father of Black Baseball,” was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1981.

Convair's Atlas missile program, selected by the U.S. Air Force's Strategic Air Command in 1954, was deployed operationally from 1959 to 1965. Atlas was a one-and-a-half stage, liquid-fueled rocket capable of launching low-orbit payloads. Its inertial guidance system could carry its nuclear payload from the U.S. to nearly any target in the Soviet Union. It was the first operational ICBM in the U. S. arsenal. The Atlas F Launch site (Dyess S-6) near Lawn is one of the first subterranean ICM silos in the United States. Seventy-two Atlas F complexes were built in 1961 in groups of one dozen each near six military facilities. The Lawn site is one of twelve built near Dyess Air Force Base. Each complex included a 185-foot deep silo lined with walls of concrete, epoxy-based resin and steel rebar, built to withstand a nuclear blast. An underground tunnel connected the main missile silo to a launch control center and its five-man crew. Above ground, an entryway provided access, while support personnel and equipment were housed in two quonset huts. The 578th Strategic Missile Squadron based at Dyess operated the site from 1962 until the Atlas program ended in 1965. After decommissioning, the missiles were removed and all sites were demilitarized. At the time, most Texans were unaware of their state's role in a global military confrontation. Years later, they could be thankful and relieved that deterrence won the conflict.

Freedmen Joseph Smith and George Washington had opened a freight and passenger business in Victoria after the Civil War. Their business was a success and they were able to live in relative prosperity in Victoria, along with other African American families. As Reconstruction ended and Texas Democrats regained control of local and state government, the prosperity and security gained by emancipated slaves was threatened. In 1877, Washington and Smith purchased more than five hundred acres on Perdido Creek between Victoria and Goliad. They sold portions of this land to other African Americans, and still others purchased adjacent property. A cemetery, churches and a one-room school were soon built, and a post office opened in 1898. The community was first known simply as "The Colony" but was later known as Perdido, Centerville and Ira Station. The name "Cologne" may have derived from the wishful thinking of residents who wanted to distract from the scent of the local rendering plant. Initially, the community's economy was based largely on agriculture, but the arrival of the Gulf, Western Texas and Pacific Railroad in 1889 allowed shipping to become a major commercial activity. Unusual for the time was an integrated depot built in the 1890s. As with many rural communities, two world wars, the Depression and urbanization caused the gradual decline of Cologne.

In 1886, the women opened the Central Hotel, which was located on the West side of North Main Street, between First and Seocnd Avenues. Although community members tried to keep travelers away from the hotel at first, the Central Hotel soon earned a strong reputation in the community and throughout the state for its fine food and accommodations, and the hotel served as an important source of income for the women.

(Vanderburg) Welch, El Paso’s first certified female architect, is credited with reintroducing Spanish-style architecture to the city. Early El Paso residents built with adobe bricks, a method common to the region. After the arrival of the railroad in 1881, El Paso grew into a thriving city, and this regional architecture disappeared, replaced by styles and building techniques that reflected the traditions and experiences of those who settled here. Within four years of their 1916 arrival in El Paso, Mabel and Malcolm Welch began designing and constructing homes. When Malcolm was hospitalized with tuberculosis, Mabel completed the construction of a home that her husband had begun. She subsequently assumed the entire design and construction process for his other projects, and continued to work on her own after his death. Through 1926 and into early 1927, Mabel designed and built nine houses in the 3100 block of Wheeling Ave. Trips across the southwest during this period introduced Mabel to the Spanish archtectural style, which she believed was more in keeping with the Spanish-Indian heritage of El Paso than the red brick bungalows that lined the city’s streets. Upon her return she designed exclusively in the Spanish Colonial Revival style. Welch continued her work in El Paso and throughout the region into the early 1950s. Examples are located in the Manhattan Heights historic district, the Castle Heights addition and along Rim Road. The state of Texas certified Welch as an architect in 1939. She designed as many as 1,500 homes in El Paso and across the southwest during her career.

The term “Syrian” relates to a semitic people whose homeland is known as the Levant, a stretch of land extending east from the Mediterranean Sea. Mount Lebanon, the only portion of the Levant where Christians outnumbered Muslims, was the greatest source of immigrants; most of these individuals became known as Lebanese after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in 1918. Between 1880 and 1924, a steady stream of Syrians and Lebanese came to the U.S. for economic opportunity. Many chose to emigrate first to Veracruz, entering the U.S. from Mexico rather than through Ellis Island. El Paso was a gateway for Syrian-Lebanese immigrants intending to settle the American southwest or west, and for some, it became their new home. The earliest known Syrians to reside in El Paso arrived here by the 1890s. These early immigrants lived close to each other, mostly along El Paso Street, and operated grocery and dry goods businesses serving mainly Spanish-speaking neighborhoods. They were diverse in their religious beliefs, but most were either Maronites or Syrian Orthodox. By the 1930s, many of the immigrants had established thriving businesses, such as clothing and real estate, or pursued professions, such as law and medicine. By 1953, there were 450 Syrian families in El Paso. Today, Syrian-Lebanese residents in El Paso remain a tight-knit community whose economic, political, and social influence on the city continues to be significant.

S. Supreme Court heard a series of significant Texas voting rights cases which collectively ended the “white primary” system established in many areas of the South after the Civil War. White primaries were unofficial, pre-election polls barred to African Americans that effectively prevented them from having any political influence. In 1950, African Americans Willie Melton, a farmer, and Arizona Fleming, a businesswoman, began a suffrage movement in Fort Bend County that led to legal action. John Terry and other black county residents agreed to lend their names as plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit filed against A. J. Adams and other officers of the Jay Bird Democratic Association. The Jay Birds functioned as a whites-only political organization that operated unofficial “straw elections” to select Democratic nominees for local elections. Since most Texans consistently voted for Democratic candidates, any nominee selected by the Jay Birds invariably won in the general elections. The case was heard in U. S. District Court in Houston, and the court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, because the Jay Birds were operating as a political party and therefore subject to state and federal laws protecting voters’ rights. The ruling enabled the county’s African Americans to vote in an upcoming Jay Bird primary election. An appeal filed by the Jay Birds was heard in 1951 by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, who overturned the original judgment. In 1952, local supporters raised funds to enable an appeal to be filed. The U. S. Supreme Court heard arguments in January 1953 and in Terry v. Adams upheld the original ruling in favor of the plaintiffs. By 1959, the Jay Bird Democratic Association had suspended activities.

The nomadic Comanches followed buffalo as they migrated, depending on the animals for food, clothing and shelter. They also relied on horses and were unmatched in their horsemanship. A major Comanche trail passed through the Camp Verde area. Settlement west of here was avoided due to fear of the Penatekas. By the 1840s, Texas Rangers had some success against the Comanches and in 1855, the U.S. Army’s Second Cavalry reduced raiding in the area; the division had outposts at Camp Verde and Camp Ives in Kerr county. Some of the Penateka Comanches were moved a year earlier to a reservation in what is now Throckmorton County; the group was later moved to the Indian Territory (Oklahoma). Other Penatekas continued to raid the county sporadically through the 1870s. After the Red River War (1874-75), the Comanches were forced onto a reservation established by the 1867 Treaty of Medicine Lodge Creek. Reservation life changed the entire societal structure for the formerly nomadic Comanches. In 1901, their reservation was broken up into allotments, and as many moved away in following years, the group dispersed. In the 1960s, the Comanches worked to rebuild their society and today they are united by common culture across geographic divides.

However, the 2nd Cavalry Division was not activated until 1941 at Fort Riley, Kansas. Among the units assigned were the 9th and 10th Cavalry regiments, the famed buffalo soldier units of the Indian Wars era, and two white cavalry regiments, the 2nd and 14th, thus constituting the army’s first integrated division. The War Department inactivated the division in 1942 to transfer personnel to armored regiments. In November 1942, the War Department directed reactivation of the 2nd Cavalry Division, assigning two new black regiments, the 27th and the 28th Cavalry. It was also announced the division would be divided between Fort Clark, Texas and Camp Lockett, California. The division activated on February 25, 1943 with headquarters at Fort Clark; command of the division was given to a native Texan, Major General Harry H. Johnson. Here on Fort Clark, over 5,000 horses trained alongside M3 Stuart Light tanks and both were featured in a June 1943 20th Century Fox movietone newsreel. Troopers endured hard training and the racial injustices of the times. The War Department determined that there was no need for a Second Cavalry Division and planned to again inactivate it. During January 1944, the 2nd Cavalry Division was dismounted and shipped back east for deployment abroad, arriving at Oran, North Africa, on March 9, 1944; the division was inactivated the next day. Fort Clark was closed after the last soldiers stationed here were deployed, and the approximately 1,500 buildings which housed the 2nd Cavalry Division were later razed. Although the 2nd Cavalry Division’s service was short lived, it remains the only all-black cavalry division in U.S. Army history and the largest mounted formation ever to serve in Texas.

In Texas, Klan membership peaked in 1923 with upwards of 150,000 members. Klansmen influenced and held positions in local and state government and in law enforcement.

District Attorney Dan Moody, a Taylor native, led prosecution against the Klansmen in a series of trials between September 1923 and February 1924. Moody tried his strongest case first against Klansman Murray Jackson. After seven days of arguments, the jurors deliberated for twenty minutes before returning a guilty verdict and offering the maximum punishment for the crime. Moody’s initial conviction led to four additional convictions and four prison sentences for the other Georgetown Klansmen on trial at the Williamson County Courthouse. <br> These trials were considered the first prosecutorial success in the United States against members of the 1920s Klan and quickly weakened the Klan’s political influence in Texas. Further, the publicity garnered by Moody following the trial led to his successful runs for State Attorney General in 1924 and Texas Governor in 1926 and 1928. He was the youngest person ever elected to both statewide offices.

West End Park was owned by I.T. Harper, a former pitcher for the Kansas City monarchs in the Negro Leagues, and his wife, Sis.

When not arranged as a baseball field, local families used West End Park as gathering places for church picnics, holiday celebrations, and family reunions for the African American community. As the Chitlin’ Circuit was a significant part of many notable performers’ careers, renowned jazz and blues artists such as Lightnin’ Hopkins, Etta James, Joe Tex, T-Bone Walker, Roosevelt Thomas Williams (aka.

Quakertown flourished through 1920, its growth due in part to its location near the city square and the opportunities it provided African Americans. The community was bounded by Withers Street on the north, Oakland Avenue on the west, Bell Avenue on the east, and by Cottonwood and Pecan Creeks on the south. Although many residents worked for businesses on the nearby city square, at the College of Industrial Arts (now Texas Woman’s University), and as servants for white households, Quakertown prospered as a self-supporting community. Several churches, a physician’s office, lodges, restaurants, and small businesses joined homes to line the streets of the community. The neighborhood school, the Fred Douglass School, burned in Sep. 1913 and was rebuilt along Wye Street in southeast Denton in 1916, foreshadowing events to come.<br> By 1920, the proximity of Quakertown to the growing College of Industrial Arts and civic-minded interests of Denton’s white residents threatened the future of Quakertown. Many believed that it was in the best interest of the college and the Denton community to transform Quakertown into a city park. In Apr. 1921, with little input from its residents, the city voted 367 to 240 in favor of a bond to purchase Quakertown. More than 60 families lost their homes. The majority of the displaced residents relocated to southeast Denton on 21 acres of land, platted as Solomon Hill, sold to them by rancher Albert L. Miles. Others, including many Quakertown community leaders, chose to leave Denton altogether. By Feb. 1923, Quakertown had disappeared in the midst of the new park’s construction.

Quakertown flourished through 1920, its growth due in part to its location near the city square and the opportunities it provided African Americans. The community was bounded by Withers Street on the north, Oakland Avenue on the west, Bell Avenue on the east, and by Cottonwood and Pecan Creeks on the south. Although many residents worked for businesses on the nearby city square, at the College of Industrial Arts (now Texas Woman’s University), and as servants for white households, Quakertown prospered as a self-supporting community. Several churches, a physician’s office, lodges, restaurants, and small businesses joined homes to line the streets of the community. The neighborhood school, the Fred Douglass School, burned in Sep. 1913 and was rebuilt along Wye Street in southeast Denton in 1916, foreshadowing events to come.
 By 1920, the proximity of Quakertown to the growing College of Industrial Arts and civic-minded interests of Denton’s white residents threatened the future of Quakertown. Many believed that it was in the best interest of the college and the Denton community to transform Quakertown into a city park. In Apr. 1921, with little input from its residents, the city voted 367 to 240 in favor of a bond to purchase Quakertown. More than 60 families lost their homes. The majority of the displaced residents relocated to southeast Denton on 21 acres of land, platted as Solomon Hill, sold to them by rancher Albert L. Miles. Others, including many Quakertown community leaders, chose to leave Denton altogether. By Feb. 1923, Quakertown had disappeared in the midst of the new park’s construction.

He grew up in Galveston's east end and honed his fighting skills working on the Wharves. During the 1900 storm, Johnson helped his family escape from their home on Broadway. In 1901, he refined his defensive skills with the help of Joe Choynski while in jail for illegal boxing. Johnson won the "Colored World Heavyweight Champion" title in 1903 but was determined to defeat white titleholder Tommy Burns. Though Burns initially refused the match, Johnson pursued him around the world until he finally agreed to fight in Australia in 1908. Johnson's technical knockout in the 14th round led to a search for a "Great White Hope" to retake the title. He defended his title in the 1910 "Fight of the Century" with a knockout of former champion James Jeffries. His victory spawned both riots and celebrations. In 1912, the U.S. government indicted Johnson under the Mann Act in an attempt to tarnish him and discourage his interracial relationships. He fled the U.S. and lived in exile for eight years. In 1915, Johnson fought his last important match in Havana, Cuba. Although younger, fitter and taller, Jess Willard needed 26 rounds to knock out Johnson and take the heavyweight title. Johnson finally surrendered to federal authorities in 1920. While in prison, he obtained two patents. Johnson continued to fight but never again for a title. He spent his later years as an entertainer and exhibition fighter. A car crash on a North Carolina road ended his life at age 68. Johnson, "the Galveston Giant," pursued his ambitions against rigid notions of racial hierarchy in 20th century America. His refusal to submit to the social standards of his time has made him an important figure in the struggle for racial justice.

In August 1941, prior to the U.S. entry into World War II, the No. 1 British Flying Training School (BFTS) of the Royal Air Force (RAF) was established with strong support from the citizenry of Terrell. <br> Both the Terrell and Kaufman Chambers of Commerce assisted in locating a suitable location for the new training school. Following the naming of Major E. F. Long of Dallas as the operator of the school, a site was selected about one mile south of Terrell on the Bond and Patton Farms. Terrell Aviation School opened shortly thereafter. In addition to the main field at the No. 1 BFTS, to ease congestion the school had two auxiliary fields to the south of Terrell on the Boykin and Tarver Farms. Civilian instructors provided the cadets with 20 weeks of preparation that included both flight training and ground school classes that covered meteorology, airmanship, navigation, and ‘link’ trainers for instrument flying. During World War II the school trained approx. 2,200 cadets from the RAF and 138 U.S. Army Air Forces cadets.<br> The motto of No. 1 BFTS was “the seas divide, but the skies unite”. The people of Terrell welcomed cadets into their community and the cadets contributed their talents to the cultural life of the town.

Lucille Graves taught classes along with her husband, Caesar; other family members later joined as faculty, as Graves expanded school services. To meet the needs of the growing school, Caesar Graves and the Mary & Mac Parent-Teacher Association began to raise funds for a new building, and in 1961, the school moved to a newly constructed structure at 902 East 28th Street. Here, Mary & Mac began offering junior high and high school courses. The faculty often worked multiple positions to meet the expanding activities offered at the school.<br> At its peak, Mary & Mac Private School served a student population of approximately 120 students. Mary & Mac closed in 1993, shortly after Lucille Graves passed away. Besides her work with the school, Graves was noted for being the first African American accepted into Texas Tech; she later earned a doctorate from the Inter-Baptist Theological Center of Houston. Today, Dr. Graves is remembered for her activism and for Mary & Mac Private School, whose graduates have made significant contributions locally, regionally and throughout the nation.

Born in Lindale (Smith co.) to educators Alexander Green and Lena (Ansley) Dean, Lexie and her family moved to Martin’s Mill shortly after her birth. Her father opened a school here, naming it Lexie Academy after his eldest daughter. Lexie spent much of her formative years in Martin’s Mill, before living in Grand Saline and various other communities. She graduated from Canton High School at the age of 15 and began attending North Texas State Normal College (now the University of North Texas), where she met her future husband, James Franklin Robertson. The couple taught in Texas and Oklahoma, before settling in Rising Star (Eastland Co.), where Lexie worked as a school principal. By the mid-1920s, Robertson left the education field to focus on her writing career. Known for her homespun poetry, Robertson was published in various publications nationwide and released her first volume of poetry, Red Heels, in 1928. She followed the popular anthology by releasing I Keep a Rainbow (1932), Acorns on the Roof (1939), and Answer in the Night (1948). In 1939, a special Texas State Legislative Committee named Robertson Texas Poet Laureate. She also participated in literary clubs and in 1944, was named Poet Laureate of the Texas Federation of Women’s Clubs. Lexie Dean Robertson died unexpectedly in Abilene (Taylor Co.) in 1954. She left behind a legacy of literature through the poems read by Texas schoolchildren of all ages and by readers throughout the nation and world.

Although several actions had granted citizenship to large numbers of Tejanos during the 1800s, some sought to disenfranchise the group. In 1896, Rodríguez came before Federal District Judge Thomas S. Maxey to gain approval for his American citizenship request. Little is known of Rodríguez, who indicated at the Bexar County Courthouse that he was born in Hijuelas, San Luis Potosí, Mexico c. 1857. However, the case in which he was involved, styled In Re Or Ex Parte Ricardo Rodríguez, activated a major influence on the incipient Mexican-American Civil Rights Movement. <br> In addition to his declaration of intention, Rodríguez submitted affidavits attesting to his length of residency and good character. San Antonio lawyers A. J. Evans and T.J. McMinn submitted two Amicus Curiae briefs suggesting that he was ineligible for naturalization based on his ancestry. Maxey considered the evidence and delayed a ruling, instead appointing a committee to examine the issues and report back. After receiving the committee briefs, Judge Maxey rendered his ruling, on May 8, 1897. While noting that Rodríguez was uneducated, could not speak English, and did not know the principles of the U. S. Constitution, Maxey affirmed he met residency and character requirements. The judge also believed that citizens of Mexico were eligible for naturalization regardless of questions of race, and resolved to grant Rodríguez’s application.<br> The political and social consequences of the ruling were significant. It established the right of Mexican immigrants to attain citizenship if requirements other than ethnicity were met and affirmed that immigrants could not be denied naturalization due to lack of education.

Dixon, or "Tommy" to friends and family, was born in August 1890 in Hearne, Texas. He first attended Bishop College in Marshall and then Meharry Medical College in Nashville in 1912. After graduating in 1916, he was granted a medical license in the State of Texas and began practicing medicine in Mart, Texas. Around 1927, Dixon relocated his practice to downtown Temple during a time when there were minimal health care services for African-Americans. It was here that he gave special attention to pediatrics and obstetrics. In addition to his professional work, Dixon played a prominent role in the community's churches and organizations. He was chairman of the board of trustees and deacon of Mt. Zion Missionary Baptist Church, a regular contributor to many of Temple's black churches, and was also involved with the Boy Scouts, the Negro Civic League and the Progressive Voters League. Specific instances of his influence on the community include his sizable contribution with other physicians to the NAACP's "Fighting Fund for Freedom" in 1954, which aimed to eliminate racial discrimination in the U.S., and his sale of building sites to the city at reasonable costs for the purpose of constructing schools. At the time of his death, Dixon was the only African-American physician practicing in Bell County. Dr. Dixon dedicated his life to the people of Temple for almost 30 years and is remembered for being driven by love and a profound sense of duty. 175 YEARS OF TEXAS INDEPENDENCE * 1836-2011 (2011) Image source: tdtnews.com<br>image url: http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tdtnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/20/22059c8e-258a-11e3-8de5-001a4bcf6878/52424aef69e85.image.jpg<br>comments: <br><br><br>county: Bell<br>city: Temple<br>address: 1717 E Avenue J<br>job number: 11BL07<br>code: <br>Year: 2011.0<br>rthl: <br>htc: <br>latitude: 31.081681<br>longitude: -97.328752<br>digitized?: <br>image url: http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tdtnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/20/22059c8e-258a-11e3-8de5-001a4bcf6878/52424aef69e85.image.jpg<br>comments: <br><br><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/egSke00NvD13O3bnFfiUUZcD0_vcc19yqJY8zimeuSezmQW-LtDcVZkwuEXGK0CVMqu94h6FfRpQtPRQDoEXZttYtJ263NesCP--kSM7LPJ0gm5LE13Si5n03tHSz2KBIbc7EBjLP7dBG_C0b2j6P8DMnKCTrR6Tf1owmrVY6ggSrJK8IiMeXO_fwCmpSWdUqCZ2p7hm0xH6l94SwYVZ5-lu3y9pyyNAfcAuLsoWDbYnAkPVuhM" height="200" width="auto" />]]></description>

Concha, whose music has been described as a synthesis of traditional Mexican folk and contemporary orchestra, served as the assistant director of Mexican President Porfirio Diaz’s Touring Military Band in 1893 and 1894. He deserted the Mexican Military while performing in the United States. Unwilling to risk prosecution in Mexico after his desertion, Concha settled in El Paso and accepted an invitation to join the McGinty Band. In 1897, he formed Concha’s Mexican Concert Band. By 1907, the band was comprised of forty members, including a dozen former members of Diaz’s Military Band. Concha’s music was favored by a diverse audience. His band performed regularly at El Paso’s Cleveland Square and at various building dedications, weddings, funerals, balls, and parties. His repertoire consisted of Mexicanized European operas, polkas, and waltzes, which were popular with music loving El Pasoans.<br> Concha, who supplemented his income working in shoe stores, was also a leader in the musical development of the community. St. Ignatius Church of El Paso hired him in 1905 to assemble a young women’s orchestra that, by 1908, began performing public concerts. Notably, Concha composed two original pieces and performed during the historic meeting of U.S. President William Howard Taft and Mexican President Porfirio Diaz at the El Paso-Juarez border on October 16, 1909. Concha’s most celebrated performance took place on April 27, 1911, when he entered Mexico for the first time in fifteen years to serenade several hundred Maderista Revolutionaries. Concha continued to influence the music of the southwest until his death. 175 YEARS OF TEXAS INDEPENDENCE * 1836-2011 (2011) Image source: elpasoinc.com<br>image url: http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/elpasoinc.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/1d/81d92f76-2c17-11e2-9f65-001a4bcf6878/509fc940d9912.image.jpg?resize=300%2C227<br>comments:<br>county: El Paso<br>city: El Paso<br>address: Evergreen Alameda Cemetery, 4301 Alameda Ave.<br>job number: 11Ep02<br>code: <br>Year: 2011.0<br>rthl: <br>htc: <br>latitude: 31.772474<br>longitude: -106.440372<br>digitized?: <br>image url: http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/elpasoinc.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/1d/81d92f76-2c17-11e2-9f65-001a4bcf6878/509fc940d9912.image.jpg?resize=300%2C227<br>comments: ]]></description>

Notably, Concha composed two original pieces and performed during the historic meeting of U.S. President William Howard Taft and Mexican President Porfirio Diaz at the El Paso-Juarez border on October 16, 1909. Concha’s most celebrated performance took place on April 27, 1911, when he entered Mexico for the first time in fifteen years to serenade several hundred Maderista Revolutionaries. Concha continued to influence the music of the southwest until his death. 175 YEARS OF TEXAS INDEPENDENCE * 1836-2011 (2011) Image source: elpasoinc.com

The June 2, 1910 edition of the Shiner Gazette reported the death and burial of J. H.

The cemetery was often overgrown and in disrepair, and being at the lower end of a field, drainage was often a problem when it rained. In 1947, the ShinerCemetery Society agreed to move burials and gravestones to a new site about two miles south known as Blue Bonnet Hill Memory Garden. Historic grave materials, including gravestones of concrete, granite, marble and metal, were moved along with remains. The oldest marked grave at Blue Bonnet Hill is for Thomas Mitchell, who died in November 1899. The Shiner ColoredCemetery now has the appearance of an open field which blooms with wildflowers each spring. However, not all burials were moved, and several unmarked graves were left undisturbed. The cemetery remains sacred ground and a precious record of generations past.

A sunken brick baptismal (later filled in) was built behind the sanctuary. N. Beckham served as pastor for 20 years. According to a 1917 account, the church had a membership of 180, paid its pastor $200 per year, and had a “splendid Sunday school, Star Light Band and W. H. M.

Mrs. T. B. "Susie" Harris, who came to Uvalde to teach at the Oak Street School in 1912, was integral in the establishment of Nicolas Street School. By 1937, increasing enrollment led the Uvalde school board to apply for federal aid to build three new buildings, two for Mexican-American students and one for Anglo students. Although they had originally promised new facilities for African-American students, the board instead decided to transfer the students to one of the older school buildings. Mrs. Harris wrote to U.S. Vice-President John Nance Garner, a Uvalde resident, asking for his assistance in obtaining a new campus. The board later received a telegram from the vice-president in support of Mrs. Harris. In 1938, the board approved the purchase of land on Nicolas Street for a new school. In a time of segregated but seldom equal facilities, the Nicolas Street School contributed significantly to the education of local African-American children. San Antonio architect Will Noonan designed and Uvalde contractor Robert Holcomb built the rectangular, single story brick schoolhouse with metal hipped roof, open eaves and exposed rafters. Two teachers, Mrs. Harris and Mrs. Jewel Kinchlow, taught eight grades here. Mrs. Kinchlow, a former student of Mrs. Harris, later became principal of Nicolas Street School until 1956. Although the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District voted to integrate public schools in 1955, Nicolas Street School remained in operation until 1965, when the school board transferred ownership of the property to the City of Uvalde.

After the death of her husband, she moved to Brazoria with the family of her youngest daughter, Elfriede Marie Herzog Prell. one of the most colorful of a new class of professional women to emerge in Texas in the early twentieth century, at a time of limited opportunities, she became a successful local surgeon and civic leader.<br> An eccentric individual with an independent spirit, Herzog pushed the boundaries of proper societal behavior for women at that time. As a skilled surgeon, though, she gained acceptance into several professional organizations, including the Texas Medical Association, the South Texas Medical Society – in which she was the first female member and later a Vice President – and the local Brazoria County Medical Association.<br> Herzog further gained the respect of local citizens and colleagues in 1907 when she was hired as surgeon of the local line of the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway. In the course of her earlier work, she utilized handcars, locomotives, and other forms of speedy transportation to answer medical emergencies, and also introduced innovative techniques for bullet extraction. In 1909, she served as the only female railroad surgeon in the world. Railway officials once attempted to dismiss her on the premises of gender, but undaunted, Herzog replied they might do so only if they found her performance unsatisfactory, and so she remained.

description: Austrian-born Sofie Deligath (1846-1925) wed Dr. Moriz Herzog at the age of 14 and in 1878 emigrated with her family to the U.S., where she attended the eclectic Medical College of the city of New York in May 1895. After the death of her husband, she moved to Brazoria with the family of her youngest daughter, Elfriede Marie Herzog Prell. one of the most colorful of a new class of professional women to emerge in Texas in the early twentieth century, at a time of limited opportunities, she became a successful local surgeon and civic leader.
 An eccentric individual with an independent spirit, Herzog pushed the boundaries of proper societal behavior for women at that time. As a skilled surgeon, though, she gained acceptance into several professional organizations, including the Texas Medical Association, the South Texas Medical Society – in which she was the first female member and later a Vice President – and the local Brazoria County Medical Association.
 Herzog further gained the respect of local citizens and colleagues in 1907 when she was hired as surgeon of the local line of the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway. In the course of her earlier work, she utilized handcars, locomotives, and other forms of speedy transportation to answer medical emergencies, and also introduced innovative techniques for bullet extraction. In 1909, she served as the only female railroad surgeon in the world. Railway officials once attempted to dismiss her on the premises of gender, but undaunted, Herzog replied they might do so only if they found her performance unsatisfactory, and so she remained. She had a prosperous 18-year career with the company and resigned at the age of 79. She died in 1925 after suffering a stroke. (2011) Image Source: houstonhistorymagazine.com

Where he presided over the innovative crew of "Termite Terrace" and introduced the world to Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny. Searching for the perfect expression to capture Bugs Bunny’s carefree attitude in a wild hare (1940), Avery recalled a phrase popular among students at North Dallas High School: “What’s up, Doc?” He spent seven years at Warner Brothers and then moved to MGM in 1942, where he perfected his unique style of rapid-fire, logic-defying gags.

The first school for African-American children was located on Main Street in a room on the first floor of the old United Brotherhood of Friendship Hall. The school was later relocated to C Street. In the late 1920s, a visionary young professor, Eugene H. Henry (b. 1896), came to Eagle Lake to teach. Born in Flatonia, Henry was educated at Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College, received a scholarship to Howard University and served in the U.S. Army during World War I. Henry, along with others, saw the need for an African-American school in Eagle Lake. Beginning in 1917, Julius Rosenwald, president of Sears Roebuck Company, began to provide matching funds for African-American schools in the South. In 1929, Eugene Henry and his supporters sought an application for a Rosenwald grant for Eagle Lake. Parents, children, churches, businesses in the black community and others responded with fundraisers and contributions. With these contributions, three and a half acres were purchased and construction of the school began in 1930 when the Rosenwald grant was received. The school was a center for African-American activities, cultural programs, sports and events. When public schools integrated in the 1960s, the school became the Eagle Lake Middle School until a new middle school was built. The E. H. Henry High School was the only Rosenwald school in Colorado County and was a symbol of vision and progress for the community and the nation during the early 1900s.

King recalled receiving drugged coffee before she was forced into the bottom of a ship with other enslaved Africans for the Middle Passage to New Orleans. King was purchased on the auction block in New Orleans by Master Jones, planter and owner of a large cotton plantation. She was then chained to the other purchased slaves and forced to march more than 450 miles by an overseer to La Grange, Texas. Jones placed King in a marriage with another slave, referred to as Bob, against her will. An exceptional cook, she prepared Master Jones' meals full time and completed other domestic tasks such as weaving cotton cloth for use on the plantation. The federally sponsored Works Progress Administration's Federal Writers' Project documented King's extensive oral history in Marlin, Texas in 1937. From her narrative, one can gather a clear glimpse of the hardships that slaves endured and acts of resistance such as the ring shout, an emotionally charged, symbolic dance where slaves came together to gain cultural and spiritual sustenance from one another. After King gained her freedom, she went on to marry twice more and serve as a member of the Galilee Colored Baptist Church in Rosebud. Following King's statement that she was born in 1803, her death certificate state that she passed away on Nov. 10, 1937, at the age of 133, making her age a point of debate and legend.

By 1952, the Art Department moved to the third floor of the newly built Hannah Hall. Under the direction of distinguished muralist and artist Dr. John T.

Some murals depict the artists’ feelings toward hope, faith and religion, while others are defiant, bold and striking depictions of oppressive police, brutal slave masters and even unforgiving nature. Overall, a theme of survival amidst insurmountable odds is apparent. The murals are a beautiful, historic monument to the spirit of the university imparted through its students. They tell the story of the struggle of a people through color, texture and time, and are a cultural treasure of Texas Southern University, Houston and the state of Texas.

Henry Kelley established his café and grocery in the 1920s, at a time when Jim Crow laws segregated and restricted all aspects of life. The café became an important part of the African American community, hosting a 1938 dance for Emancipation Day and a 1942 dance to benefit the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (later the March of Dimes). Edward Bratcher, Sr., a prominent African American chef at the Bluebonnet Hotel, became manager and changed the name to Bratcher's Place. In 1944, property owner A. L. Lewis sold Bratcher and his wife, Cordellia Mills Bratcher, the restaurant and other adjacent property. With segregation excluding African Americans from music venues, entrepreneurs created an alternative known as the Chitlin' Circuit. Tour stops hosted local performers and nationally-known jazz, rock and rhythm and blues musicians. During this time, the restaurant began hosting musical acts and changed its name to the Famous Door Café, advertising as being "famous for friends, food and fun." As new musical trends developed, The Famous Door inegrated its lineup, including groups from Kerrville and San Antonio often credited as early developers of psychedlic rock in the 1960s. Patrons later recalled The Famous Door as the first integrated business in Kerrville that welcomed all customers before it closed in 1996. Music provided a common language that helped bridge cultural and generational gaps.

Commanding officers of the troops were white, but the black soldiers were included in every part of daily and social post life.<br> One black officer stationed at Fort Elliott was Henry O. Flipper, commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1877. Born of slave parents in 1856, he was the first black graduate of the United States Military Academy and the first black commissioned officer in the United States Army. Flipper embarked on a forty-year military and civilian career on the western border and frontier. In the fall of 1879, his regiment of the 10th Cavalry was ordered to Fort Elliott. As post adjutant, Lt. Flipper served as the executive officer. All post business was transacted through him. Being educated as an engineer at West Point, one of his duties was to oversee building the telegraph line across the Canadian River to Fort Supply.<br> The black soldiers’ role in clearing the Texas panhandle of indians, outlaws and rustlers may have been tedious sometimes, but was crucial to fulfill the goal of settling the west. Fort Elliott was abandoned in 1890 when indians were no longer a threat and law and order was established by civilian courts.

Julius Rosenwald, president of Sears, Roebuck and Company, in collaboration with African American educator Booker T. Washington, provided funding to build African American schools throughout the south, ranging from one- to seven-teacher units. The Rosenwald Fund came with numerous requirements, including financial support from local school authorities and private contributions.

By the time the program ended in 1932, over 5,300 schools were built in fifteen states. <br> In Wood County, eight schools were built under the Rosenwald program. The one-teacher schools were McMillan, built during the 1923-24 school year and Reinhart, built from 1927-28. The two-teacher schools were Webster (1924-25), Lloyd (1927-28) and Winnsboro (1928-29). The Muddy Creek School, built during the 1921-22 school year, included a teacher’s home and a shop building, as did the Hawkins Rosenwald School built during the 1927-28 school year. In addition, the Fouke (Fauke) School, built during the 1922-23 school year, included a teacher’s home. Oral interviews revealed that the Fouke School was altered and renovated, and now is the Fouke Community Center. Julius Rosenwald and Booker T. Washington provided the plan and financial assistance but the black community and local governments brought their plan to fruition with their determination for education.

Ailey was born in Rogers, a small rural community in eastern Bell County, to Lula Elizabeth Cliff (1912-1944) and Alvin Ailey, Sr. (1911-1974). While still an infant, Alvin’s parents separated. Growing up in Rogers and other small towns in Texas, Ailey was influenced by church services, music and movement in the black community. Searching for employment, Lula and Alvin moved to Los Angeles in 1942. There were many opportunities for Alvin to expand and foster his creative gifts. <br> In high school, Alvin met modern dance teacher Lester Horton. At Lester Horton Studios, Alvin developed his craft and gained confidence. After Lester died suddenly in 1953, Alvin took over the company and moved it to New York City. He danced and acted in several Broadway plays and musicals and two motion pictures. In 1958, Ailey created Blues Suite, which became his first masterpiece. He followed with the equally moving ballet, Revelations, in 1960.  Both works drew upon his childhood and represented African American traditions, struggles, values and joys. Throughout his career, Ailey earned many awards and garnered significant firsts. Ailey’s dance company, educational centers and scholarships helped sustain black concert dance in the twentieth century while his ballets facilitated an appreciation for black culture in music and literature.

From 1821 to 1910, more than five million Germans emigrated, more than any other European country. Providing a potential escape from this misery was the Adelsverein. The Adelsverein accounted for 7,380 of those during three years of operation from 1844-1847 but their advertising enticed many other German immigrants who utilized the footholds that the Verein had established to come to Texas. One popular slogan was “geh mit ins Texas,” or “go with us to Texas.” Prince Karl of Solms-Braunfels, one of the members and a cousin of England’s Queen Victoria, was chosen to execute their mission in Texas as the commissioner general in America. With his determination, Karlshafen developed into a significant port. <br> With revolutions and discontent in Europe in the 1840s, many Germans, as well as other nationalities, continued to pour into the German infrastructure eventually established by the Verein at Galveston and Karlshafen. Indian Point in Karlshafen, a shell beach separated from the mainland by a chain of lakes and marshes, was a successful debarkation point for thousands of German immigrants. Many followed the route to the Verein settlements of New Braunfels and Fredericksburg in the Texas hill country but some settled other areas of Texas including Calhoun County itself. The city of Indianola, born of Karlshafen, became a major port that helped settle the west. At a high price with the loss of many lives early on, these German immigrants made lasting contributions to the culture of Texas in their pursuit of a better life.

His brother’s father-in-law, Nick Oldem, was the first documented burial in Harrington Cemetery (1872). The sites of the original Cassady and Clark cemeteries were on land owned by African Americans. Jacob Cassady (1808-1908) purchased the Cassady cemetery land near Garza in 1872. He and his wife, Melinda (1821-1904), are buried in this family cemetery. Zack Rawlings and George Clark purchased the Clark Cemetery land west of Garza in 1876. The oldest legible marker is Nancie Rolling (1879). Present-day Lewisville Lake covers the area where these cemeteries were first established. Meggs & Son Funeral Home deeded Cassady and Clark Cemeteries to Denton County after relocating the burials.

The efforts and influences of African American jazz musician Eddie Durham can be seen in many aspects of jazz music and musicians today. Eddie Durham was born in San Marcos on August 19, 1906 to Joseph Durham, Sr., a well-known fiddle player, and Luella Rabb (Mohawk) Durham. From an early age, Eddie’s talents were apparent as he performed with his family in the Durham Brothers Band. At the age of eighteen, Eddie began traveling and playing in regional bands. His experiences with the “101 Ranch Brass Band”, Edgar Battle’s “Dixie Ramblers” and Gene Coy’s “Happy Black Aces” all led to his being picked up by “The Blue Devils” out of Oklahoma. <br> In 1929, Eddie recorded with recognized Kansas City band leader and pianist Bennie Moten, playing trombone and guitar. Around this time, he recorded a guitar solo on new Vine Street Blues that alternated single-string style, a new method popularized by Durham. Eddie became central to the Kansas City style of swing that was developing in the 1930s. Working with Moten, Durham helped create the iconic big band style that is known today. He later joined Jimmie Lunceford’s band, “Lunceford Express,” and recorded the first amplified guitar in 1935 while playing hittin’ the bottle. The impact of this innovation can be seen through many jazz musicians that followed Durham. Eddie’s talent extended beyond playing as he was a successful music arranger for Lunceford, Kansas City Five and Count Basie. One of his best-known arrangements is In the Mood for Glen Miller’s Big Band. Eddie Durham’s musical talents created a lasting impact on jazz through his music and influence on many great jazz musicians.

In 1848, Texas patriot Sam Maverick claimed the spring as part of his headright survey. By the next year, travelers on the New Military Road from San Antonio to El Paso were using the spring as a regular resting place for wagons bound for California. Fort Clark was established on June 20, 1852. The U.S. Army walled the spring pond in 1902 and created a swimming pool fed by the spring. The present pool was constructed for the army in 1939 through the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and is the largest ever built on any post.

The driving left-hand bass patterns that are uniquely characteristic of Boogie Woogie piano, so highly suggestive of a steam locomotive chugging over iron rails, clearly are inspired and influenced by the sounds of the logging camp and the rail yard. <br> Itinerant piano players rode the rails, often performing in exchange for free rides, and the music traveled with them, first to red-light districts of Texarkana and Shreveport, followed by Houston and New Orleans, then gradually reaching African American neighborhoods in St. Louis, Kansas City and Chicago. Brothers George and Hersal Thomas were among the first to publish sheet music for Boogie Woogie, which they said they first heard in East Texas. Boogie Woogie masters Huddie “Lead Belly” Ledbetter, Floyd Dixon and Dave Alexander (Omar Sharriff) grew up in the Marshall area. An East Texas original, Boogie Woogie may still be found in many genres of music today.

Boogie Woogie masters Huddie “Lead Belly” Ledbetter, Floyd Dixon and Dave Alexander (Omar Sharriff) grew up in the Marshall area. An East Texas original, Boogie Woogie may still be found in many genres of music today. (2013) Image Source: claudecat17.tumblr.com

Harriss (1889-1977) moved to Denton in 1914 from Nebraska to become the first women’s physical education teacher at North Texas State Normal College, now University of North Texas (UNT). With a degree from the University of Nebraska in physical education, Harriss coached the university’s first women’s athletic teams and instructed every sport except football. She organized the physical education department in 1918, which grew under her direction, and the green jackets club, whose purpose was to support all activities of the college. <br> Harriss was a founder in 1923 of the Texas State Physical Education Association (now Texas Association of Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance), serving as president in 1933. She was also a founder of the Texas Woman’s Athletic Association in 1924. Established in 1928 at UNT, Harriss was one of twelve charter members of the RHO Chapter of Delta Psi Kappa, a national fraternity for the promotion of interests in the field of physical education. She was named honorary national president in 1960. The first recognized Girl Scout in Texas, Harriss started the first troop at the College in Denton in 1917. She helped build the scout lodge at hills and hollows in South Denton in 1923. Harriss and 12 other professors from the college were charter members of the Denton County Teachers Federal Credit Union in 1936, now DATCU. <br> After 46 years at UNT as a teacher and women’s athletics activist, Harriss retired in 1960.

description: eulah A. Harriss (1889-1977) moved to Denton in 1914 from Nebraska to become the first women’s physical education teacher at North Texas State Normal College, now University of North Texas (UNT). With a degree from the University of Nebraska in physical education, Harriss coached the university’s first women’s athletic teams and instructed every sport except football. She organized the physical education department in 1918, which grew under her direction, and the green jackets club, whose purpose was to support all activities of the college. 
 Harriss was a founder in 1923 of the Texas State Physical Education Association (now Texas Association of Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance), serving as president in 1933. She was also a founder of the Texas Woman’s Athletic Association in 1924. Established in 1928 at UNT, Harriss was one of twelve charter members of the RHO Chapter of Delta Psi Kappa, a national fraternity for the promotion of interests in the field of physical education. She was named honorary national president in 1960. The first recognized Girl Scout in Texas, Harriss started the first troop at the College in Denton in 1917. She helped build the scout lodge at hills and hollows in South Denton in 1923. Harriss and 12 other professors from the college were charter members of the Denton County Teachers Federal Credit Union in 1936, now DATCU. 
 After 46 years at UNT as a teacher and women’s athletics activist, Harriss retired in 1960. She was inducted into the North Texas Athletic Hall of Fame in 1987, 10 years after her death. Harriss devoted her life to the youth and citizens of Denton and is remembered each February 27th on Beulah Harriss day. The Girl Scout little house stood near this site.

Recognized as one of the first “Chicano Renaissance” authors, Trambley earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in English literature from the University of Texas at El Paso. She taught high school in El Paso for more than 40 years, including over two decades as a teacher of home-bound students. An internationally-acclaimed author, she lectured extensively at universities across the United States and Europe. <br> Trambley’s contributions to the arts and to higher education are an important part of El Paso’s artistic legacy. She was co-founder of Los Pobres, a bilingual theater in El Paso. Her plays premiered in many theaters across the country, including the Chamizal National Memorial Theater and the Chicano Theater of El Paso Community College. In 1972, Trambley became the first woman to win the Premio Quinto Sol, a prestigious literary prize recognizing the work of Chicano and Chicana authors. In the 1960s, she hosted “Stella Says,” a political radio show. She also directed and wrote “Cumbres,” a television cultural program, in the 1970s. <br> Trambley contributed to Chicana literature in its formative years and was the inspiration for many writers who fought gender stereotypes. “Look at all the women in my stories,” Trambley told an interviewer in 1982. “They’re very independent; they create their own universes; they are very unorthodox. They aren’t held down by rules and regulations.” (2014) Image source: bookdepository.com & azquotes.com<br>image url: http://d20eq91zdmkqd.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/large/9781/5586/9781558615021.jpg<br>comments: <br><br><br>county: El Paso<br>city: El Paso<br>address: Chamizal Theatre, Chamizal National Memorial Park<br>job number: 14EP01<br>code: <br>Year: 2014.0<br>rthl: <br>htc: <br>latitude: 31.766631<br>longitude: -106.457453<br>digitized?: <br>image url: http://d20eq91zdmkqd.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/large/9781/5586/9781558615021.jpg<br>comments: <br><br><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/SqS-vRQCuUxG4cPeLJOpSbwpXjYtJQfgBJ4am6J1QKbZ98OHBP8tOTPDymXigX9ml8JmVMmTodMO6yALHzJyR3bgiAQxZCLXdUhXMePJSJs6MUNRsS7ul0aDzyud-VToMZ8VOtT_82pBDwt9nPmQbAIt8d0Yi451Oq8WLFdm2suxwpLtgRzklIBgRQFGFZx70gACOrpXsmDfZ16IxUrEM1vAxkjx8eEumt9r3EzPlAltYWlErio" height="200" width="auto" />]]></description>

That summer, Mary received her teaching certificate from the hunt county normal school, locally known as the county teachers institute for colored teachers. Mary started teaching at a time when many African American students were just starting to attend school. Following the Civil War, schools for freed slaves were not open in hunt county until 1881. Mary taught at North School and East Colored School in Greenville, where there were about 300 African Americans enrolled in the schools. She taught at these schools for 45 years. <br> Mary earned her Bachelor of Science degree from Prairie View A&M College in 1934, which was something of a rarity in Greenville. By 1926, Mary was the assistant principal and teacher for grades five through eight at North School. In 1930 she became principal at Fred Douglass Elementary school. Fred Douglass was previously known as East Side Colored School. Mary remained principal there until her retirement in the late 1940s. Mary pushed her students to succeed and wanted her students in Greenville to achieve a higher graduation rate than any other public school in Texas. While she was involved in education in the Greenville Community and the state of Texas, she was also involved in the local New Hope Baptist Church. She was a Christian missionary at New Hope Baptist for more than 20 years. Mary Jim Morris died November 20, 1973, at her home in Greenville.

In 1954-55, Steer Stadium also hosted home games for the Jasper High School Bulldogs, the town’s baseball team for white students, who had no home field of their own.

Many of those who made the roster served their communities as teachers, authors, ministers, school administrators, coaches, businessmen and leaders, and even as baseball players in the major leagues. The team enabled players to showcase their talents, and the games provided community entertainment and created role models for African American youth.

By the 1890s, African Americans were searching for their own place of worship in the growing community. For a time, they gathered in private homes or met under a shade tree to read bible verses. While riding the combination train into Clarendon, a young African American cowboy, Matthew “Bones” Hooks (1867-1951), met Reverend Sid Stephens and persuaded him to help organize a church for the African American population. A location was found in an empty shelter in 1897 and Rev. Stephens gave the new church his name and stayed on as pastor. Bones Hooks also remained in Clarendon and helped build St. Stephens before he married and moved to Amarillo. Pastors included Rev. Stephens, Rev. L.G. Farley and Rev. A.G. Monagram.<br> In May 1918, the church building was destroyed by a massive flood. However, under the leadership of Rev. Pickford, the congregation found a new location and in spite of declining membership, the church remained strong. In 1930, Rev. J.J. Hayden organized the first choir who sang at church services and performed for the public on special occasions. In the 1940s, a building was moved from Lelia Lake to Clarendon to be used by St. Stephens. During the next thirty years, the congregation held many fundraisers to support the church and celebrate its heritage. The old schoolhouse was purchased for the pastor’s home and a baptistery was added to the church. As the first African American church in the panhandle, St. Stephens Baptist Church has survived for more than a century due to the determination of the congregation and community.

On April 1, 1888, the inaugural game for the Texas League was played at Fair Grounds Park, with Houston defeating Galveston 4-1. In 1896, the grandstands were rebuilt with enough seats for 2,500 spectators. It continued to hold games for the Texas League, major league exhibitions and top African American teams in Texas until 1904, when the six blocks where the field sat were developed. Less than a year after baseball moved away, the blocks were subdivided and sold as residential and commercial properties.

After a valiant fight alongside Seminole Chief Coacoochee (known as Wild Cat), and emancipation by Gen. Thomas S. Jesup, John Horse was removed to the Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) with hundreds of his people in June 1838, but within a short time John was back in Florida serving the U.S. Army as interpreter, scout, combatant and as a mediator with Seminoles in the latter part of the war. For his services, John was officially granted his freedom by future President Gen. Zachary Taylor.<br> From his new home in Indian Territory John Twice journeyed to Washington, D.C., to plead his people’s case to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. Years later John claimed he and Gen. Jesup met with Pres. Polk to discuss the plight of the Seminoles. In late 1849, oppressed and hunted after their freedom was withdrawn by the federal government, two groups of Seminoles and blacks, led by horse and Coacoochee, slipped out of Indian Territory into Texas, en route to freedom in Mexico. The band rested briefly here at Las Moras Spring in early July 1850. In time, John settled his group at Nacimiento on land made available by the Mexican government. In exchange, the Seminoles provided protection from Apache and Comanche. When the Seminole Scout Detachment was formed at Fort Duncan in 1870, John returned to Texas. In 1876, while living in the Seminole Camp at Fort Clark, John survived a third attempt on his life in an ambush near this site. After recovering, he returned to Nacimiento, Mexico. Following a trip to meet with Pres. Porfirio Diaz to plead for his people’s permanent land rights in Nacimiento, he died in Mexico city in 1882 at the age of 70.

Born to Nicasio and Jovita (Vivero) Idar, Idar and members of her family participated in social, political and labor activism in both the United States and Mexico. She received her teaching credentials in 1903 from the Holding Institute, a Methodist school in Laredo, and taught Mexican children at a school in Los Ojuelos. Disenchanted by scarce resources, Idar returned to Laredo to contribute to her family’s newspaper, La Cronica. Her writings reported on gender inequality, discrimination against people of Mexican origin in the United States and forms of extralegal violence such as lynchings. <br> In 1911, Idar met with other activists in the First Mexican Congress to discuss civil rights in Texas. As a result, the League of Mexican Women was formed, with Idar as the group’s first president, to offer free education to Mexican children. Idar was highly critical of U.S. Intervention during the Mexican Revolution. After she wrote a scathing article about President Woodrow Wilson, Texas Rangers came to Idar’s home to destroy La Cronica’s equipment. Idar stood in her door to refuse their entrance, although the rangers returned to destroy Idar’s presses. She also joined La Cruz Blanca, a medical team that nursed revolutionary soldiers. After moving to San Antonio, Idar established the Democratic Club and a free kindergarten for Mexican American children. Until her death in 1946, Idar was dedicated to improving the lives of Mexicans and Mexican Americans, women and children through her writings and activism.

In 1988, he received the Wichita County Medical Society’s Distinguished Service Award.

The hospital featured 16 patient rooms and a surgical suite. It was located only two blocks from Scott & White Hospital and Clinic, thereby providing African American patients access to technology and specialized care that was previously denied to them.<br> The hospital was administered by a Public Advisory Board comprised of an equal number of African American and white citizens. Final decisions were made by the Scott & White Board of Trustees. U. S. Senator Lyndon Baines Johnson served on the Scott & White Board of Trustees at this time and partook in the fundraising campaign.<br> Cora Woods Campbell Anderson, the largest individual donor to the campaign, was known community-wide for her commitment to helping out college students and families with financial issues and generously giving to the Negro Hospital Project.

description: Officially opened on May 17, 1953, Cora Anderson Negro Hospital offered medical services to the growing African American population of Temple and Greater Bell County. The hospital featured 16 patient rooms and a surgical suite. It was located only two blocks from Scott & White Hospital and Clinic, thereby providing African American patients access to technology and specialized care that was previously denied to them.
 The hospital was administered by a Public Advisory Board comprised of an equal number of African American and white citizens. Final decisions were made by the Scott & White Board of Trustees. U. S. Senator Lyndon Baines Johnson served on the Scott & White Board of Trustees at this time and partook in the fundraising campaign.
 Cora Woods Campbell Anderson, the largest individual donor to the campaign, was known community-wide for her commitment to helping out college students and families with financial issues and generously giving to the Negro Hospital Project. The Advisory Board unanimously agreed to name the facility after her.
 Once the facility opened, Scott & White physicians provided care, but the nurses and support staff were overwhelmingly African American. The hospital operated until December 1963 when Scott & White moved to integrate facilities at South 31st Street.
 In late 1969, the Bell County Commissioners Court acquired the building. Now called the Cora Anderson Building of the Bell County Health District, the Public Health District runs the facility as an outpatient health clinic, though it preserves the building’s original mission of serving the poor and disenfranchised.

It was not until after the Civil War that the Freedman’s Town began to grow and thrive. Records differ as to when and how quickly African Americans settled here, but by 1900, Oak Cliff contained more than 500 African American residents, almost a sixth of the town’s population.

Residential buildings date to as early as 1910 and are relatively unchanged. Oak Cliff Cemetery, established in 1846 by settler William Beaty, is within the heart of the district near the 1928 N. W. Harllee School. Other significant buildings include the 1889 Sunshine Elizabeth Chapel CME (demolished 1999) and the 1886 Greater El Bethel Baptist Church. The degree to which these historic buildings remain standing and in good repair marks the Tenth Street Area as one of the more well-preserved African American communities of this time period remaining in the Dallas Metropolitan Area. Oak Cliff’s Tenth Street Historic District was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1994 in recognition of its cultural significance and architectural value.

The African American community raised $53 to move the frame building of the former school for white students after a new one was built. The land where the building was moved was donated by Anna W. Doyle, who was the head teacher for nearly two decades. The one-room schoolhouse had no utilities until running water was installed in 1920 and electric lights were installed in 1923. The black population in Kerrville was small and only 25 students from five north Kerrville families attended. The school expanded to include three classrooms, an auditorium, two bathrooms and a storage area. There was still no formal name for the school at the time. As enrollment grew to about 75 students in 1940, husband and wife B.T. and Itasco Wilson and Miss l.E. Cheeks were hired as teachers. B.T. (Prof) Wilson was revered in the community for his dedication to the students of Doyle. It was Wilson who decided that the school should be named after Anna W. Doyle. <br> The school had high enough enrollment for athletic teams, cheerleaders, a choir and a marching band. Classes included sports, theater, music and home economics, alongside traditional academic subjects. Integration of the Kerrville schools in 1964 reduced the school to a one-year program for elementary students. After one year, all African American students were integrated. In 1970, Doyle became a kindergarten campus under the direction of Starkey Elementary School Principal, Fred H. Tally, and Head Teacher, Jean Tally. B.T. Wilson continued to positively influence students in his new position and the sixth grade school was eventually named for him. The Doyle School building was sold to a non-profit neighborhood association and remains open as a community center.

Land for the church and community was provided by descendants of the Devereaux family. Church records indicate that in 1868 newly freed African Americans led by Reverend Green Lewis and his wife, Phoebe Devereaux, established the Anadarko Christian Church. The first public school for African Americans was held in the Anadarko Christian Church. In 1917, Julius Rosenwald, president of Sears, Roebuck and Company, and Booker T. Washington established the Rosenwald Fund to assist in the foundation of schools for African Americans in the South. With money from the Rosenwald Fund ($900), public donations ($2,100) and private contributions from students and parents ($600), the Anadarko Colored "Rosenwald" School was built in 1926. The building was a three-teacher school typical of the rural schools built by the Rosenwald Foundation. Over the years, the name of the school changed several times to Laneville Colored School to Allen High School (named for U. E. Allen, former principal) prior to merging with the Laneville Independent School District. The old classrooms were moved to expand the campus during the years 1967-69 to accommodate additional students after integration. The only remnant of this historic Rosenwald School is the pier and beam foundation where the gymnasium was erected. The building may no longer function but the memory of the first public school in the area will live on as an important reminder of early African American educational efforts.

Sustaining the community’s cultural identity became increasingly important. Recognizing the need for recreational space in which to celebrate their heritage, community leaders petitioned the City of Austin for a neighborhood park. In 1931, the city purchased land at this site for that purpose. The new park was named for Gen. Ignacio Seguin Zaragoza, the hero of the Battle of Puebla (Cinco de Mayo 1862), who was born in the Mexican village of Presidio de la Bahía del Espíritu Santo (present-day Goliad, Texas). The park soon emerged as a cultural hub. <br> Local Tejano business and civic leaders established a board to organize activities and celebrations held at the park. A Comité Patriotico formed to foster goodwill locally and internationally through celebrations centered on the park, including the Fiestas Patrias of Diez y Seis de Septiembre and Cinco de Mayo, which featured music, dancing, speeches and coronations. Conjunto, a native form of Tejano music, predominated at these gatherings, often serving as the embodiment of the community’s desire for greater acceptance through recognition of its own distinct culture and legacy. <br> Beginning in 1931, organized baseball games brought large crowds from surrounding communities.

description: Austin’s Tejano (Mexican-American) population expanded substantially in the early 1900s, and racial segregation concentrated the growth in East Austin. Sustaining the community’s cultural identity became increasingly important. Recognizing the need for recreational space in which to celebrate their heritage, community leaders petitioned the City of Austin for a neighborhood park. In 1931, the city purchased land at this site for that purpose. The new park was named for Gen. Ignacio Seguin Zaragoza, the hero of the Battle of Puebla (Cinco de Mayo 1862), who was born in the Mexican village of Presidio de la Bahía del Espíritu Santo (present-day Goliad, Texas). The park soon emerged as a cultural hub. 
 Local Tejano business and civic leaders established a board to organize activities and celebrations held at the park. A Comité Patriotico formed to foster goodwill locally and internationally through celebrations centered on the park, including the Fiestas Patrias of Diez y Seis de Septiembre and Cinco de Mayo, which featured music, dancing, speeches and coronations. Conjunto, a native form of Tejano music, predominated at these gatherings, often serving as the embodiment of the community’s desire for greater acceptance through recognition of its own distinct culture and legacy. 
 Beginning in 1931, organized baseball games brought large crowds from surrounding communities. The local community treated each game as a cultural celebration, complete with food and music. Later, the community officially organized Sunday games in the park. In 1941, residents employed by the national youth administration built a recreation center. In 1996, at the Cinco de Mayo celebration, a new recreation center was dedicated. Today, Parque Zaragoza still serves as a reminder of a proud heritage.

Mr. Randolph Titus, Principal of Dogan High School from 1936-1968, instilled pride in education in his students despite social and educational obstacles. Mr. Titus’ success may be measured by the success of his students. Dogan alumni went on to be notable educators, dentists, doctors, lawyers, ministers, veterans, public officials and more. Academic programs at Dogan High School proved among the best in the area and enrollment increased. Dogan fully integrated in 1968.

J. Campbell School at this site served African American students from the town and surrounding area. The school opened in 1903 at a time when the need was evident for new educational facilities to serve growing African American communities of the area. Originally named the Nacogdoches Colored School, it was renamed for longtime principal E. J. Campbell in 1937. Like many other communities at the time, Nacogdoches and its educational institutions were segregated in accordance with state and federal laws. Officially, these facilities were to be "separate but equal," although in reality they often lagged behind in terms of financial support and education opportunities. The original school, a simple four-room schoolhouse, became a central educational and social meeting place for African American communities in Nacogdoches County. Students came from miles around to attend the new school, which continued to grow over the subsequent decades. Significantly, beginning with principal Campbell's term, and under his direction, high school students regularly visited Prairie View Normal School (later Prairie View A&M University) to learn of higher education opportunities available to them. At one point, more than two-thirds of the students graduating from the E. J. Campbell School went on to attend college and excel in a number of professional fields. Notably, many of the students became certified as teachers at Prairie View and returned to work in the Nacogdoches school district.

Her organizational skills and leadership helped make the WAC a respected part of the American military and opened new possibilities for women in U.S. postwar society. Born in Killeen on January 19, 1905, Oveta was the second of seven children of Isaac W. and Emma Elizabeth (Hoover) Culp. A good student, she developed an interest in law and state government from her father, a state representative. She gained skills as a legislative parliamentarian and as a reporter for the Austin Statesman before moving to Houston. There she renewed a family friendship with former governor William P. Hobby, president of the Houston Post-Dispatch. They married on February 23, 1931. In May 1942, with America at war, Oveta Culp Hobby was appointed director of the newly organized Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC). Under Colonel Hobby’s leadership, the WAAC provided American women the opportunity to help in the war effort. The first WAAC officers graduated in August 1942. Less than a year later, the WAAC became part of the U.S. Army as the WAC. By the end of the war, more than 99,000 members of the WAC served with army commands in all theaters of the war. Colonel Hobby resigned in June 1945 and returned to Houston. She remained there and continued her service to the city, and from 1953 to 1955 served as the first U.S. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare during Pres. Dwight Eisenhower’s administration. A decorated World War II officer and respected business and civic leader, Oveta Culp Hobby died in Houston on August 16, 1995. (2007)]]></description>

        <name>First Juries to Sit Women in Dallas County</name>

Efforts to add women to jury lists began soon after passage of the 19th amendment , when it became clear that the right of jury service would not be granted to women along with the right of suffrage. These efforts hastened during the 1930s and 1940s. During this time, local newspapers drew attention to the issue by reporting on women who were called to jury duty by mistake, and the Dallas Morning News pointed out the absurdity of a system that would allow female district judges but denied those same women the right to sit on a jury. The amendment to the Texas Constitution requiring that women serve on grand and petit juries was finally approved by voters on November 2, 1954. Although women were not officially added to the Dallas County jury selection lists until August of 1955, women who continued to be called to duty "by mistake" had the right to serve for the first time. In November 1954, Adelyne Dransfield, the sole female member of the jury on which she was serving, was elected as one of the first female jury "foremen" in Dallas County. The first occcasions for women to serve on juries in Dallas County were key steps in the ongoing struggle for gender equality and the achievement of full citizineship rights for women in Dallas and throughout the nation. The first women to serve on juries in Dallas County asserted their right to complete this very important job of citizenship with legitimacy and confidence. (2008)]]></description>

Hard-pressed for pilots by mid-summer of 1942, General Arnold requested that Cochran return from England and put her women airforce pilots (WASP) plan into action. A WASP flight school, opened at Houston's Municipal Airport in late 1942, outgrew its facilities and was relocated to Avenger Field in Sweetwater. The school operated here from February 20, 1943 to December 7, 1944, during which time it became the first and only all-women military flying school in the world. The program successfully trained women to fly every kind of overseas duty. Of the 25,000 women who applied for WASP flight training, only 1,830 were accepted to the program. Of this number 1,074 went on to gain their silver wings and fly over 60 million miles on operational duty; 38 of them lost their lives serving their country. Considered civilian employees during the war, WASP pilots finally gained military benefits after special legislation passed in 1977. (1993)]]></description>

Educated in the public schools of Houston and La Grange, Anne Webb Blanton began her teaching career in 1887 in the small Fayette County town of Pine Springs. In 1888 she moved to Austin, where she taught public school and attended the University of Texas. After receiving her bachelor's degree in 1899, Blanton became a member of the faculty at North Texas State Normal School in Denton. In 1916 she was elected the first woman president of the Texas State Teachers Association. Two years later she became the first woman elected to statewide office in Texas when she won the race for State Superintendent of Public Instruction. During her four years in office she was instrumental in the passage of much-needed progressive education legislation. Earning a master's degree in 1923 and a doctorate in 1927, Blanton became a full professor at the University of Texas in 1933./ She founded the Delta Kappa Gamma Society for women educators in 1929. Dr. Annie Webb Blanton died in 1945, leaving behind a legacy of professionalism and vision to inspire generations of Texas women. Elementary schools in Austin, Dallas and Odessa were named in her honor. She is buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Austin.

The tenth of 13 children born to tenant farmers Susan and George Coleman, famed aviatrix Bessie Coleman was a native of Atlanta, Texas. The family moved to Waxahachie when Bessie was two years old. She followed her brothers to Chicago in 1915 and developed an interest in flying. Because she could find no one in the United States who would teach an African-American woman, Coleman learned to fly in France and obtained her international pilot's license in 1921. Upon her return to the United States, she was hailed as the first black woman to pilot an airplane. Bessie Coleman died in an air accident in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1926 and is buried near Chicago. (2002)	Image credit: www.pbs.org]]></description>

The Review Club opened their library in 1900. By 1903, the popular library had to move to larger facilities. The club sought funds from philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, who offered $15,000 for a building. The local Federation of Women's Clubs, under leadership of may Moulton Harrison, provided the site, and the City formed a board of trustees for the public library, which opened in 1904. The library moved to new facilities in 1954 and again in 1996. Renamed for local historian W. Walworth Harrison, the son of May Harrison, the library continues to serve its community.

        <description><![CDATA[Dr. Mollie W. Armstrong (January 23, 1875-May 23, 1964). Mary Elizabeth (Mollie) Wright Armstrong was instrumental in establishing optometry as a profession in Texas during the first half of the 20th century. A native of Bell County, she briefly attended Baylor Female College in Belton, where she met her future husband, Walter David (W.D.) Armstrong. They married in 1892 and moved to Brownwood. W.D., a watchmaker, opened a store in partnership with his brother and, as was the business custom at the time, the store inventory included eyeglasses. Mollie's interest in optometry began when a traveling optical salesman fitted her with glasses, curing her chronic headaches. Studying on her own, she completed a Kellum and Moore School of Optometry correspondence course. She excelled in her studies and finished her degree in Refraction at the Atlanta, Ga. Campus in 1899. She returned to Brownwood and opened and optical department in the family store, becoming the first woman optometrist in Texas. She earned her Doctorate of Optics from Northern Illinois School of Optometry in 1905. A leader in her profession, Dr. Armstrong was a charter member of the Texas Optometric Association, which she served as the first woman president in 1923. Gov. Miriam A. Ferguson, a Bell County childhood friend, appointed her to the Texas State Board of Examiners in Optometry. Dr. Armstrong later worked on national issues as a board member of the American Optometric Association. She was also a Brownwood civic leader, supporting libraries and parks, serving on the Chamber of Commerce, and founding the local Business and Professional Women's Association.

        <description><![CDATA[Mame Roberts (Aug. 19, 1883-Dec. 24, 1976). The daughter of James M. and Martha Sue (Baxter) Roberts, Mame Roberts lived her entire life in or near the community of Howe. Largely self-taught, she worked as a substitute teacher in the lower grades at the Howe Public Schools in the early 1900s before turning to her life's work-promoting civic improvements and beautification. As the writer of a weekly column in the Howe Messenger, Mame Roberts promoted her hometown and encouraged its beautification. Her campaign to make Howe the "prettiest little town in Texas" motivated other small Texas towns to take similar action. A series of articles in the Dallas MorningNews provided step-by-step instructions for carrying out beautification efforts, and she was in great demand as a speaker at garden club gatherings throughout this part of the state. Mame's work attracted the attention of Life magazine and Reader's Digest, and she was named "Woman of the Day" on May 14, 1949, on Eleanor and Anna Roosevelt's national radio program. Her leadership positions included: president of the Grayson County Federation of Women's Clubs; president of the Texoma Redbud Association, which urged the planting of redbuds along highways in Texas and Oklahoma; and founder and president of the Howe Sesame Club. Her work, which spanned the decades before and after World War II, is a significant part of the civic history of Howe and of all the towns that put her lessons into action. (2002)]]></description>

The program sought to teach these children a vocabulary of 400 essential words to enable them to successfully complete the first grade.Isabel Verver, a 17-year-old Ganado High School student, read an article in a Spring 1957 issue of Texas Outlook Magazine that expressed Felix Tijerina’s desire for such a program. Tijerina was a successful Houston businessman as well as the national president of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC). Verver contacted Tijerina and expressed her desire to implement such a program. Both Tijerina and Verver knew what it was like to be a first-grader unable to communicate with their teachers or fellow students, and hoped to remove that language barrier.Baytown educator Elizabeth Burrus supplied a list of 400 vocabulary words to Tijerina that she had formulated from years of teaching bilingual students. Verver taught the pilot class in Ganado during the summer of 1957 and produced 60 “graduates” in time for the fall school term. Seeing Verver’s success, LULAC established similar classes in towns such as Vanderbilt, Edna, Sugar Land, Aldine, Brookshire and Wharton for summer 1958. Tijerina and members of LULAC worked for passage of House Bill 51 during the 56th Texas Legislature. The bill established a state-sponsored program called preschool instructional classes for non-English speaking children and eliminated the need for the privately funded “Little Schools.” Head Start and other federally-funded programs of the 1960s eventually took the place of the state-sponsored program.(2009)]]></description>

For the first several years of her life, the family occupied a frame house at this location. Later they moved to Beaumont. The Didriksons encouraged their children to develop their natural athletic abilities. Called "Baby" by her family, Mildred was later nicknamed "Babe" for baseball star Babe Ruth. Babe first demonstrated her athletic skill as a high school basketball star. After training in track and field events, she won two gold medals at the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. An exceptionally versatile athlete, Babe excelled in baseball, bowling, tennis, and other sports. Eventually she concentrated her efforts on golf and won many tournaments as both an amateur and a professional. The Associated Press named her the "Woman Athlete of the First Half of the 20th Century." In 1938 Babe married George Zaharias. Popular with sports fans for her skill and personality, she won further admiration during a long and courageous battle against cancer. She died in Galveston and was buried in Beaumont.

She graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School in 1960 and attended Port Arthur College and Lamar State College of Technology (Lamar University) in Beaumont. A liberal and outspoken free spirit, Janis rebelled against the conservatism of her hometown, and in 1962 she moved to Austin to study art at the University of Texas. She connected to the burgeoning Austin music scene and began singing in clubs around town, most notably at Threadgill's, a bar operated by Texas country singer and yodeler Kenneth Threadgill. With her raw and raspy singing style exhibiting the blues, jazz, country, cajun, gospel and soul music influences of east Texas and Louisiana, she was a popular local performer. Searching for wider acceptance, Joplin moved to San Francisco in 1963 and quickly became part of the growing folk music and counter-culture movement of the 1960s. Her performances at the 1967 International Pop and Jazz Festivals in Monterey brought her widespread recognition. Her first album, Cheap Thrills, with the band Big Brother and the Holding Company, was a wild success even as her personal life became marred with alcohol and drug abuse. Later recording with the Kosmic Blues Band and the Full-Tilt Boogie Band, she was an international sensation by the end of the decade. In August 1970, at the height of her fame, Joplin returned to Port Arthur for her ten-year high school reunion. Just two months later, she died of an accidental overdose of heroin and alcohol; her ashes were spread along the coast of northern California. Her final album, Pearl, released after her death, earned a gold record. (2007)]]></description>

Austin's old three hundred colonists, settling near Brazoria. Sarah married Archelaus Bynum Dodson of nearby Harrisburg on May 17, 1835. As tensions mounted between Mexico and the Texian colonists, a call for military volunteers was circulated in September 1835, and Archelaus Dodson became First Lt. in Captain Andrew Robinson's Harrisburg Volunteers. Sarah offered to design and make a flag for her husband's company. Using blue, white, and red calico, she fashioned a flag of three equal squares, with a five pointed white star in the center of the blue square. Reportedly the first Lone Star flag, the banner was displayed in the town of Gonzales in October 1835, and in December flew during the Siege of Bexar. When the Declaration of Independence was signed, two flags were seen flying over Convention Hall. One was described as a Lone Star flag and is believed to have been the one made by Sarah Dodson. Following the Texan victory at San Jacinto, the Dodsons lived in Fort Bend County, then moved in 1844 to Grimes County. They donated the land for Bethel Cemetery (5 mi. N) where Sarah was buried in 1848. Texas Sesquicentennial 1836 - 1986  Image credit: www.findagrave.com]]></description>

Their family moved to Texas in 1830, settling in Gonzales. Andrew was a carpenter, farmer and rancher before joining in the fight for Texas independence. He was killed at the Battle of the Alamo. Soon afterwards, the Kent family joined in the Runanway Scrape, fleeing Gonzales under the orders of Gen. Sam Houston. After the war, the Kent family eventually returned to their home on the Lavaca River.In 1845, Mary Ann married William Byas, a freighter. She managed their farm and household of seven children. In 1864, William returned from serving in the Confederacy during the Civil War, but died shortly afterwards. With a large family to support, Mary Ann sold much of her property and in 1869, afera a malaria outbreak, moved her family near waters west of Johnson Creek, about two miles below present day Mountain Home. This creek became known as BYas Branch. Mary Ann and her children were among the earliest settlers in the area.In the early 1870s, a typhoid fever epidemic took the lives of four of Mary Ann's children. In 1879, Mary Ann married Robert Chambers, a farmer and blacksmith; he passed away a year later. In 1881, she wedded her third husband, John "Pap" Morriss. Afterwards, the two moved to land near Schumacher Crossing on the Guadalupe River south of Hunt. John Morriss died in 1897. Although she lost her sight and much of her hearing, Mary Ann continued to stay in her log cabin, where many visitors came to hear her tell of life in early Texas. In 1917, Mary Ann died and family buried her in Nichols Cemetery. Today, she is remembered as a noted pioneer who braved the hardships of the turbulent early years in Texas history.

Alma Male and Female Institute was established in 1852 just east of the town square on land donated by Margaret Hallett. The local Masonic lodge provided space in their building for church and school purposes for many years. A public school was established in 1877 when the Baptist and Methodist churches joined to operate a graded school in the old Masonic building. A site for a permanent school was acquired in 1885, and the following year a two-story building was erected. Supported by the community and local taxes, the school expanded its programs to serve the needs of its students. In 1907 an election was held in which the Hallettsville School District was declared independent from the county school system. A two-story red brick school building was erected in 1908 and was in use until it was destroyed by fire in 1919. A new building was completed in 1920, and other facilities have been added over the years. Hallettsville schools were integrated in 1966, and the former Stevens-Mayo School for blacks became a junior high school. Texas Sesquicentennial 1836-1986]]></description>

Under the leadership of an energetic French nun, Mother Ambroise, the Sisters bought land at this site and erected two frame buildings. Many prominent Liberty families enrolled their daughters in the convent school, as boarders or day students. The turmoil of the Civil War (1861-1865) caused attendance to decline, and the institution closed in 1866. Occupied by two other academies in the late 1860s, the Ursuline buildings were dismantled in the 1880s.  (1978)]]></description>

Named for a version of the hand-clapping song “Mary Mack,” emphasizing aspirations for the students to become contributing members of society, the institution offered an alternative to local public schools in a time when private schools for African Americans were rare. Teachers received permission from the Rev. A.L. Dunn to hold their first classes in the auditorium of New Hope Baptist Church, before soon moving to two small frame houses on the 1300 block of east 24th street. Lucille Graves taught classes along with her husband, Caesar; other family members later joined as faculty, as Graves expanded school services. To meet the needs of the growing school, Caesar Graves and the Mary & Mac Parent-Teacher Association began to raise funds for a new building, and in 1961, the school moved to a newly constructed structure at 902 East 28th Street. Here, Mary & Mac began offering junior high and high school courses. The faculty often worked multiple positions to meet the expanding activities offered at the school. At its peak, Mary & Mac Private School served a student population of approximately 120 students. Mary & Mac closed in 1993, shortly after Lucille Graves passed away. Besides her work with the school, Graves was noted for being the first African American accepted into Texas Tech; she later earned a doctorate from the Inter-Baptist Theological Center of Houston. Today, Dr. Graves is remembered for her activism and for Mary & Mac Private School, whose graduates have made significant contributions locally, regionally and throughout the nation.

While serving as principal of a school near Milano, Mrs. Trigg was asked by the United States Department of Agriculture in 1911 to supervise Texas' first Girls' Tomato Club. Her role included organization, teaching, and experimentation. In Aug. 1912, her clubs showed canned products at Milano Fair-- the state's first exhibit of this kind, and a great success. In 1913-14, she worked in Childress and Milam counties, holding canning schools financed by local groups and the U. S. Department of Agriculture. After enactment of national and state legislation (1914-1915) established the Agricultural Extension Service at land grant colleges, Mrs. Trigg became (in 1916) the first county home demonstration agent in Texas. Stationed in Denton, she also served on staff of the College of Industrial Arts (now Texas Woman's University), overseeing courses in methods for home demonstration work, assuring its professionalism. Edna Trigg was a native of Milam County, daughter of Ervin and Rachel Walker Westbrook. She married (in 1892) Charles Letman Trigg, and was mother of Charles Westbrook Trigg and Eloise Trigg (later Mrs. Johnson). Mrs. Trigg is buried in I. O. O. F. Cemetery, Denton.

Karle Wilson, daughter of William and Kate (Montgomery) Wilson, was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, in October 1878. Her parents moved to Nacogdoches by 1900, and after attending college and teaching, Karle moved to Nacogdoches in 1905. In August 1907, she married local banker Thomas E. Baker, and the couple had two children. Karle Wilson Baker first published in 1903 with a poem in Harper's magazine. In the 1910s, she became the most frequently published poet in the Yale Review. Yale University Press published her first collections of poems, Blue Smoke and Burning Bush, and Old Coins, a book of fables. These publications established her national reputation. In 1924, the Dallas News labeled Baker "The Poet of Quiet Things," and Southern Methodist University awarded her an honorary doctorate of letters. Baker showed versatility, writing poems, essays and novels. The State Textbook Commission adopted her children's history reader, The Texas Flag Primer. Her 1931 collection of poems, Dreamers on Horseback, was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry. Two of her successful historical novels, Family Style (1937) and Star of the Wilderness (1942), were set in east Texas. When the State Board of Regents dedicated Stephen F. Austin State Teachers College on April 30, 1924, Baker read two poems, "Within the Alamo" and "The Pine Tree Hymn," and the latter became the college's first school song. She began teaching at the college in 1924 and taught there ten years. Stephen F. Austin State University houses the majority of her papers. Baker wrote in her diary that "writing my poems is seldom more laborious than skimming the cream from my thoughts. It just needs time and quiet to rise." (2007)]]></description>

The WASP program was started under General H.H. ("Hap") Arnold to train women to fly every kind of mission short of combat, releasing male pilots for overseas duty. Jacqueline Cochran was director of women pilots; Ethel A.

The WASPs flew 60 million miles on operational duty; 37 lost their lives serving their country. WASPs had civil service--not military--status, but were granted eligibility to apply for reserve commissions in the Air Corps after the WASP program ended when the allies were winning the war in Europe and the U.S.A. pilot shortage was past. Avenger Field was closed after a short post-WASP span of service as a missile base. (1972)]]></description>

Here girls, like male cadets, learned to fly United States Army Air Forces planes. WASPs had civil service status rather than military. Of the 25,000 applicants, 1,830 were accepted; 1,074 won wings and flew 60 million miles for the U.S. Army Air Forces, receiving high praise for their record. At the request of the Air Forces' Commanding General H.H. ("Hap") Arnold, Jacqueline Cochran became director of women pilots. On November 17, 1942, when the first 28 trainees entered the women's flying training detachment at Houston Municipal Airport, the program began. On February 21, 1943, it was relocated at Avenger Field, 3 miles west of Sweetwater. The last class of WASP's graduated on December 7, 1944. British Royal Air Force cadets trained at Avenger Field June 22-August 1, 1942. U.S. Army Air Forces April of 1943. Arrival of WASP trainees made Avenger the only military coeducational flying field in United States history. WASP's came from varied backgrounds. Many were wives, sisters, or sweethearts of servicemen, hoping to hasten war's end. Women staff advisors supervised the nonflying activities of WASP trainees, who lived under military discipline: In army barracks. Trainees flew in "zoot suits" (ill-fitting GI coveralls), and had tan slacks and shirts for dress wear. After the santiago blue uniform was officially adopted, it was worn by graduates. Originally, the seven months course included 180 hours of ground school, 115 hours of flight training. From light planes, WASPs advanced to fly every air corps craft in use at the time. WASPs ferried planes; towed targets; flew tracking, smoke-laying, searchlight, strafing, and simulated bombing missions; did radio control flying, tested aircraft, gave instrument instruction; performed many other duties. Thirty-seven WASPs gave their lives serving their country. Ethel A. Sheehy was WASP staff field executive; Nancy Harkness Love, WASP staff executive-ferrying division; Leoti Clark Deaton, WASP staff executive-training base. (1972)]]></description>

Martha Reagan moved with her parents from Tennessee to Fayette County, Texas where she met and married John Rabb (1825-1872). In 1857, John and Martha moved their family to Nueces County and settled near Banquete, where John pursued cattle ranching under the Bow and Arrow brand. Rabb raised far more cattle than his ranch land could support by running his herds on the open range. He became one of the most successful cattlemen in the area, owning more than 10,000 head of cattle when he died in 1872. When Martha assumed control of the business, she took it in a dramatically different direction. Forseeing the end of the free-range era, she capitalized on the panic and flight caused by violent raids along the Nueces strip and aggressively began to buy land here in 1875. Within a year, she owned more than 43,000 acres, some of which she bought for as little as 37 cents per acre. Enclosed within 40 miles of fence, the Rabb Ranch included this site and stretched from north of Robstown south to Driscoll, and was bordered on the west by the Petronilla and Banquete Creeks and on the east by present-day Callicoate Road (FM 1694). She became known as a "Texas Cattle Queen." (1992)]]></description>

The club was federated as an affiliate of the Texas Federation of Women’s Clubs later that year. Since its inception, the club’s membership has bettered the community through the four areas of world affairs, fine arts, home science, and green thumb. For the first several years of the club’s existence, the group met in members’ private homes. In 1916, property at the northeast corner of South Main and East Lee Streets was purchased for the building of a clubhouse. Although World War I delayed construction, the modest structure was completed in 1923 and provided a meeting room, kitchen and restroom. A library and an enlarged meeting room with a raised stage were completed in 1941. During World War II, the club hosted a USO club for troops from nearby Fort Wolters. Community outreach has been an important aspect of the Twentieth Century Club’s activities since its formation. In 1966, the club spearheaded the restoration and beautification project at Holland Lake. The group offers local scholarships, provides books and school supplies to Weatherford Independent School District, and supports several community organizations such as Meals on Wheels and Dental Health for Parker County. The clubhouse has been the site of political forums, weddings, anniversaries and recitals. Fledgling church congregations have also been invited to meet at the facility.

A director and innovator, she played a key role in the careers of many actors and playwrights, most notably Tennessee Williams and William Inge; The Glass Menagerie and Inherit the Wind were among the Broadway shows she directed. She was an advocate for non-profit professional residential theatres and theatre-in-the-round, and she carried out her ideas both on Broadway and in her Dallas theatre. Named one of the Outstanding Little Theater Directors in America, she also organized the Houston Community Players. She died in Dallas in 1955, but her influence continues today.

The family moved to Virginia, where O'Keeffe and her siblings attended school. She studied art at various schools before enrolling in the Art Institute of Chicago and later the Art Students League in New York City. She then worked as a commercial artist before attending classes at the University of Virginia. In order to gain teaching experience, she taught art in Amarillo between 1912 and 1914. The Texas Panhandle attracted her as an artist because of "the openness. The dry landscape. The beauty of that wild world." In 1914, O'Keeffe returned to the East, studying at Columbia University in New York, and teaching in Virginia and South Carolina. At Columbia University, she met Arthur Wesley Dow, who greatly altered her vision of art. Influenced by east Asian painters and the British Arts and Crafts movement, he inspired her to approach painting in a more abstract manner. O'Keeffe returned to Texas in 1916 as a faculty member at West Texas State Normal College, now West Texas A&M University, where she held classes in Old Main. Inspired by the landscape, particularly Palo Duro Canyon, she began incorporating themes from nature in her work, moving away from Representationalism. O'Keeffe showed many of her Texas pieces at Alfred Stieglitz's New York City gallery in 1917. The following year, she moved to New York and in 1924 married Stieglitz, a noted photographer. Both artists produced large bodies of acclaimed work. Following Stieglitz's death in 1946, O'Keeffe moved to New Mexico, where she continued to explore her creative vision and unique style, shaped in part by her Canyon years. Today, she remains a major influence in American Art. (2005)]]></description>

They became the first Polish settlers in Robertson County in 1875. Assisted by J. C. and Mary Roberts, on whose farm he worked, Bartula wrote letters urging other Polish immigrants to join him. Soon 50 families arrived from Poland and 60 moved here from the Marlin area. By 1885, the town of Bremond had the largest Polish settlement in Texas, 345 families. Bartula later bought his own farm and became a leader in community and church affairs. The Bartulas had ten children. (1975)]]></description>

Kelley was born in 1832 in Buckingham Co., Virginia, to Radford and Susan Kelley. Bill’s oldest sister, Martha, married Pleasant Jennings in 1839 and moved to this area (then in Polk County), where Pleasant became an overseer on the hightower plantation. Bill became the head of his family when his father died of an unknown illness. By 1851 he joined his sister and brother-in-law in Texas, accepting a job as an overseer on the Todd Robinson Plantation. Dinah rush was born a slave in Alabama in 1848. Her owner and likely father, Otis Rush, arrived in this area around 1852. According to an 1860 census, he owned 17 slaves including Dinah, who was described as Mulatto (mixed African-American and Caucasian heritage). Bill Kelley served in the 25th regiment of the Texas Cavalry, C.S.A., during the Civil War. In 1863, he was taken prisoner at Fort Hindman, Arkansas, and was later transferred to Fort Butler, Illinois. In 1867, he bought 154 acres of land; ultimately the Kelley farm would comprise nearly 700 acres and become known for its hogs, potatoes, yams and cotton. Bill Kelley and Dinah Rush had ten children: Eliza, Lawson, Mittie, Harley, Lois, Herndon, Susan, Will, Fanny, and John. Laws against interracial marriage prevented Dinah from marrying the father of her children or sharing their surname. In 1884 Dinah died shortly after delivering her tenth child. Bill died in 1922 surrounded by his children and grandchildren. Today descendants include leaders in business, law, medicine, and education, the products of a loving union and enduring values.

        <description><![CDATA[Josepha Rodríguez, known as "Chipita," was hanged in 1863 for the murder of John Savage. She remained the last woman legally executed in the state of Texas until 1998. Little is known of Rodríguez' life, though it is believed that she was the daughter of Pedro Rodríguez; they moved to San Patricio de Hibernia when Chipita was young. Chipita earned money by hosting travelers on the Cotton Road, a section of the Camino Real which ran through Texas and passed over the Aransas River near her house. In August 1863, John Savage, a horse trader, roomed at the Rodríguez homestead. Soon afterwards, he was found dead in the Aransas River. Sheriff William B. Means arrested Rodríguez, believeing she murdered savage for $600 in gold which he was carrying; Means also arrested Juan Silvera as an accomplice. A grand jury indicted the two, and although the missing gold was recovered prior to the trial, Rodríguez was found guilt of Murder. The jury recommended leniency, because of the circumstanital evidence, but Judge Benjamin Neal sentenced Rodríguez to hang. She was executed on November 13, 1863. Her age at the time was unknown, though she was likely at least sixty years old. The trial's fairness was questioned because of the jurists' problematic personal histories, Rodríguez' weak defense counsel and the lack of a motion for retrial, among other issues. Most of the court records have been lost, and discrepancies exist in trial accounts. Rodríguez' hanging has contributed to local lore and has been the subject of numerous writings and other works. In 1985, the Texas Legislature absolved Josepha "Chipita" Rodríguez of murder in a resolution signed by the Governor. (2008)]]></description>

He married Mary Jane Matthews Larn near Fort Griffin and in 1884 became minister of Albany Presbyterian Church, just as West Texas farmers and ranchers were struggling to survive the effects of a prolonged drought. Local leaders selected Brown to represent them in seeking funds for the purchase of seed wheat for small farmers. Brown departed in August 1886 to appeal to financial institutions in eastern cities. Newspaper editors publicized his quest as he traveled, and he soon drew the ire of Texas editors and land and railroad promoters who feared the publicity would harm the state's economic development. Thanks to his efforts, however, several railroad cars of seed wheat were sent to Texas, as well as several thousand dollars collected by eastern Presbyterian churches. Believing it was as appropriate to ask for drought relief as to seek aid following hurricanes, Brown appealed to Clara Barton and the American Red Cross. Brown returned home, and at the request of twenty-one counties addressed the Texas Legislature. A bill passed authorizing relief funds and Gov. L.S. (Sul) Ross signed in into law. Meanwhile, the Red Cross sent clothing, household goods and tools to Albany. In January 1887, Clara Barton arrived to tour Shackelford, Stephens, Young and Callahan counties. On her way home, she visited the Dallas Morning News and lef a personal church for $20, encouraging the editor to solicit funds to help the drought-stricken farmers. In 1887, John Brown moved from Albany to Massachusetts, where he served in the state legislature. He later wrote a book entitled Twenty-Five Years a Parson in the Wild West. (2006)]]></description>

In 1902, the Tyler Free Library Board requested funding for a library building from philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie agreed to provide $15,000 to the City of Tyler for a library, but stipulated that the city donate the building site and furnishings and maintain the library at a cost of no less than $1500 per year. A lot was purchased at the northwest corner of South College and West Elm, and fundraising efforts throughout the community provided the books, furnishings, landscaping and telephone services for the new library. The Chicago architectural firm of Patton & Miller designed the Italian Renaissance-style building, with R.H. Downing of Tyler as architectural supervisor and D. Mahoney of Waxahachie as builder. The original library housed children’s and adults’ reading rooms, a check-out desk, book shelves and an office on the first floor, while the second floor included an auditorium with stage and two small dressing rooms. For many years this was the only public auditorium in Tyler. A 1936 addition, which doubled the size of the original building, features murals depicting life in east Texas by Texas artist Douthitt Wilson. The building is a two-story masonry structure, built with standard size buff brick and limestone. An overhanging red clay tile hipped roof tops the building in a low profile, and keystones and cut stone embellishments frame all windows and doors. The main entry is topped by a broken pediment and stained glass transom. (2010)]]></description>

J. T. Upchurch (b. 1870) for the protection of homeless girls and unwed mothers. Nine years later he opened the Berachah Industrial Home at this site. Ten buildings were located here, including a print shop for publication of the "Purity Journal". The cemetery, which contains more than eighty graves, was first used in 1904 for the burial of Eunice Williams, one of the residents. The home closed in 1935, but the site was used until 1942 as an orphanage run by Upchurch's daughter Allie Mae and her husband Frank Wiese. (1981)]]></description>

T. H. Mundine of Burleson introduced a woman suffrage bill in the state legislature. In the following five decades Texas women formed suffrage organizations to lobby for the right to vote. The suffragists included Rebecca Henry Hayes, who organized the Texas Equal Rights Association (TERA) in 1893; and sisters Annette, Elizabeth, and Katherine Finnigan, who founded the Texas Woman Suffrage Association (TWSA) in 1903. The TWSA, renamed the Texas Equal Suffrage Association (TESA) in 1916, led the final push for voting rights. The movement's leaders during this period included Jane Y. McCallum, Minnie Fisher Cunningham, Eleanor Brackenridge, and Annie Webb Blanton. In March 1918 Rep. C. B. Metcalfe of San Antonio sponsored successful legislation giving women the right to vote in primary elections. It was signed into law by Gov. William P. Hobby just 17 days before the voter registration deadline for that year's election. In that short period of time, more than 386,000 Texas women registered to vote, including many who gathered at the Travis County Courthouse at this site. On June 28, 1919, Texas became the 9th state to ratify the Woman Suffrage (19th) Amendment to the U. S. Consitution. (1991)  Image credit: www.theautry.org]]></description>

Born in Muenster, Westphalia, Germany, Elisabet grew up beautriful, talented, and self-willed. At 19 she began to study at the Academy of Arts, Munich, where her skill and charm brought many admirers, and her strong opinions made some think her eccentric. Before she was 30, Elisabet had produced statues of German royalty and many European statesmen. In 1863 she married Dr. Edmund Montgomery, whom she had met as a young medical student from Scotland. In 1870 they moved to the United States and in 1872, to Texas, which they liked for its vastness and its high regard for freedom. They purchased the famous Liendo Plantation in present Waller County and there reared two sons, only one of whom lived to adulthood. In 1892 Elisabet built this studio, "Formosa," in which to execute statues of Stephen F. Austin and Sam Houston for the Texas exhibit at the 1893 World Fair. The statues now stand in the State Capitol. Here she also did a recumbent statue of military leader Albert Sidney Johnston, which lies over his grave at the State Cemetery in Austin. Elisabet Ney and Dr. Montgomery are both buried at Liendo. (1968)]]></description>

Educated in the public schools of Houston and La Grange, Anne Webb Blanton began her teaching career in 1887 in the small Fayette County town of Pine Springs. In 1888 she moved to Austin, where she taught public school and attended the University of Texas. After receiving her bachelor's degree in 1899, Blanton became a member of the faculty at North Texas State Normal School in Denton. In 1916 she was elected the first woman president of the Texas State Teachers Association. Two years later she became the first woman elected to statewide office in Texas when she won the race for State Superintendent of Public Instruction. During her four years in office she was instrumental in the passage of much-needed progressive education legislation. Earning a master's degree in 1923 and a doctorate in 1927, Blanton became a full professor at the University of Texas in 1933./ She founded the Delta Kappa Gamma Society for women educators in 1929. Dr. Annie Webb Blanton died in 1945, leaving behind a legacy of professionalism and vision to inspire generations of Texas women. Elementary schools in Austin, Dallas and Odessa were named in her honor. She is buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Austin. (1988)]]></description>

Owned by Dr. John R. Brinkley, the powerful radio station across the Rio Grande from Del Rio reached listeners around the country. A.P. Carter, his wife Sara, and his sister-in-law, Maybelle, first broadcast from the station during the 1938-39 season. For the next few years, they and others performed gospel and folk standards, early elements of country music. Often opening their "Good Neighbor Get-Together" show with "Keep on the Sunny Side," the group at times included other family members, who continued to influence American music for many decades.

She graduated from Judson Female Institute in Marion in 1837, and in 1839 she met General Sam Houston. Houston, who had completed his term as the first President of the Republic of Texas, was visiting Alabama for business ventures. Despite their 26-year age difference, the two married in 1840. During their marriage, Margaret was successful in curbing the General's use of alcohol and in encouranging him to become a dedicated church member.The Houstons owned residences in Houston City and in Cedar Point. In 1841, Gen. Houston was elected to his second term as President of the Republic of Texas. For the first time, Texas had a First Lady, as Margaret joined her husband at the temporary capital of Washington-on-the-Brazos. During the presidency, the couple had the first of their eight children. After the term, the Houston family moved to a plantation they named Raven Hill (14 mi. E). While her husband later served a s a U.S Senator, Margaret Houston managed the plantation and participated in church, social and literary activities. She also underwent surgery and treament for breast cancer.The family later lived in Huntsville at their Woodland home and in Independence. Margaret Houston continued to raise her family and, when General Houston became Governor, again served as First Lady. The couple later moved to the Steamboat House in Huntsville. After her husband died in 1863, Margaret Houston returned to Independence, where she provided for her children until her death from yellow fever in 1867. Today, Margaret Moffette Lea Houston is remembered as a First Lady and the matriarch of one of the most significant families in Texas history. (2008)]]></description>

Following Joseph's service in the War of 1812 in Illinois, they lived in Arkansas Territory on the Red River before moving into Texas in 1820. In 1823, they left the Red River area to join Rachel's parents, William and Mary Smalley Rabb, as members of Stephen F. Austin's "Old 300" colony. As pioneers in this colony, the Newmans received land grant no. 59 from Mexico - a league and a labor of land in what became Wharton County, including this site. An early census listed Joseph Newman as a farmer and stock raiser. They had ten children-Mary, William, Louisa, Minerva, Sarah (known in Texas history as Sally Scull), Elizabeth, Thomas, Ali, Joseph, Jr., and Andrew-and experienced firsthand the austerity of the Texas frontier. Upon Joseph's death in February 1831, he was buried at a now-unknown location on his league of land. Four years after Joseph's death, Rachel gave her interest in the Newman lands to her children, but continued living on her original homesite. She also inherited Rabb property in Matagorda County from her parents. By 1854, the entire Newman League had been sold out of the family. Rachel moved to Dewitt County, where she married again. She is buried in the Salt Creek Cemetery on the Dewitt-Karnes County line. Joseph and Rachel Newman's children lived on to serve their state and country in a variety of ways. As Texas pioneers, the Newmans helped settle a new land and built a foundation for those who came after them. (2002)]]></description>

Charlye graduated as valedictorian of Booker T. Washington High School at age 15, and from Prairie View A&M College in 1948 at the age of eighteen with a degree in political science. After a year of teaching, Charlye pursued her interest in becoming an attorney. Farris received her law degree from Howard University in Washington, D.C. in 1953. During her final year, Farris’ class worked on the landmark racial desegregation case, Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka. Charlye was sworn in on Nov. 12, 1953 as the first black woman to be licensed to practice law in Texas. Charlye started a solo practice in Wichita Falls, becoming the first black, male or female, to actively practice law in Wichita County. Charlye faced many obstacles and much discrimination in Wichita County and within the legal profession. However, in 1954, Farris was selected to serve as county judge pro-tem, making her the first black person to serve as a judge in the south since Reconstruction. Among her many awards, such as the American Bar Association’s Margaret Brent Women Lawyers of Achievement, one of her proudest was serving on the board of regents of Midwestern State University, where she was not permitted to attend earlier as a student due to her race. During her 56 years of legal practice, Charlye served her community in numerous ways. Her life is a testament to the determination and the impact one individual can have on a community, state, and nation. (2011)]]></description>

SE). Because of the proximity of the grave site to the town of Leander, the skeleton became known as the Leanderthal Lady. Carbon testing indicates the woman lived 10-13,000 years ago. She was about 30 years old at the time of death and measured 5' 3" in height. As one of the earliest intact burials uncovered in the United States, the site is a valuable source of information on the nation's prehistoric past. (1985)]]></description>

        <name>The Flores de Abrego Family and Floresville</name>
        <description><![CDATA[The Flores de Abrego family came to the New World from northern Spain before the time of the American Revolution. During the 18th century, members of this family brought their cattle northward and established ranches along the San Antonio River. The head of this family was Francisco Antonio Flores de Abrego II (d. 1757), who married Rosa Hermenegilda Hernandez. Their son, Jose Joaquin Flores de Abrego (1742-c. 1800), grew up on the San Bartolo Ranch in present Karnes County. Jose Joaquin's grandsons Manuel, Salvador, Nepomuceno, and Jose Maria later fought on the side of the Texians during the revolution for independence from Mexico. In 1854 Josefa Agustina Flores de Abrego, daughter of Jose Maria Flores de Abrego, married Samuel William Barker, who became Wilson County's first sheriff in 1860. In 1867 Josefa's donation of 200 acres of land was accepted by the County Commissioners Court as the site for the new county seat. As she requested, the new town was named Floresville in honor of her ancestor, Francisco Antonio Flores de Abrego II. As prominent ranchers, with cattle brands registered in Floresville, the Flores de Abrego family played an important role in the colonization of this area.

        <description><![CDATA[Born in Indiana in 1843, Agnes Mary ("Addie") Kinter married Edwin Smith Graham in 1865. Upon hearing of the opportunities for land development in Texas, Graham traveled to Texas many times during the 1870s. In 1872, he and his brother, G. A., founded this town. They gave land for a county courthouse and set aside lots for churches, schools, and cemeteries. In 1879, E. S. and Addie Graham brought their children to live in the new town. Twelve years later, they moved to Spokane, Washington, where Col. Graham had other business ventures. He died there in 1899. Addie Graham returned to Graham and continued her husband's philanthropic efforts. She contributed to the building of a city auditorium, endowed a Bible teaching position in the Graham schools, and donated land on which was built a home for the aged poor of the county. In 1907, the city's first water pumping station was built to replace the individual wells and cisterns that had been used since the town's founding. The water remained untreated, however, until 1910, when Addie Graham gave the money for a filtering plant. The facility, built at this site, was in use for 75 years. Addie Graham died in 1929. Her contributions have had a lasting impact on the town's growth and development. Texas Sesquicentennial 1836-1986]]></description>

Born just outside Palestine in 1866 to Nathaniel and Jennie (Beeson) Hunter, Mary Kate Hunter played a significant role in recording, promoting and preserving the history of Palestine and Anderson county. Educated at Palestine Female Academy and Sam Houston Normal Institute, she studied piano with classical musicians across the United States and in Germany, and taught piano to countless Palestine children. As a clubwoman, she was a charter member of the Self-Culture Club in Palestine, organized in 1894; served as a delegate to the first annual meeting of the Texas Federation of Women's Clubs in 1898;organized a local chapter of the Women's National Foundation in 1921 for the preservation and study of local history; and founded and led the Fort Houston chapter of the Daughters of the Republic of Texas. A supporter of voting rights for women, Mary Kate Hunter organized and was first president of the Palestine Equal Suffrage Association, and held statewide office in the Texas Equal Suffrage Association in 1915-16. In addition to her civic duties, Hunter also was a published poet, editor of a local society journal and board member of the Texas State Library. She extensively researched the history of Palestine and Anderson County and conducted dozens of oral history interviews with early area residents. At her death in 1945, she bequeathed her voluminous collection of material to the Palestine Public Library, where it remains in use as an important record of Anderson County history.

        <description><![CDATA[(1809-October 31, 1891) German natives Conrad and Mary Theresa Hennecke Juergens came to Texas in 1833, the year of their marriage, and built a cabin near this site. In March 1836 as the Texas Revolution was raging, many Texas settlers, in fear of the advancing Mexican army, fled their homes in what became known as the Runaway Scrape. The Juergens family chose to remain, but soon were victims of a raid by Indians, thought to be members of the coastal Karankawa tribe. Conrad Juergens was wounded, and Mary and two of Conrad Juergens' young sons from a previous marriage were captured. Pregnant at the time of her kidnapping, Mary gave birth to a girl, Jane Margret, while in captivity. Months later, mother and daughter were ransomed at Coffee's Trading Post on the Red River, suggesting they were traded by the Karankawas to a nomadic tribe. The Juergens' sons were not rescued. Mary and Jane returned to Conrad, but he died within two years. After a brief second marriage to George Grimes, Mary married Samuel Redgate in 1843. They moved to Dayton, Ohio, where Mary died in 1891. Redgate and Jane Margret returned to Texas and settled in Parker county, where in 1936 the State of Texas erected a monument at their graves to honor them and Mary. (1992)]]></description>

Claudia Potter graduated from the University of Texas Medical Branch in 1904, the only woman in a class of 23, and only the sixth woman to graduate from the Medical Department. After an internship at John Sealy Hospital in Galveston, Dr. Potter worked as a physician in San Antonio for a year. Hired in 1906 by Dr. Arthur C. Scott, Dr. Potter was the first woman to serve as a line physician for the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway, and as an anesthetist for the Temple Sanitarium. Her initial salary was $420 a year, plus room and board, much less than her male counterparts received. Dr. Potter was regarded by her peers as the first full time anesthesiologist in Texas, and was the first to administer nitrous oxide by machine. During her tenure, she trained many nurse anesthetists, and helped to develop Temple Sanitarium (Scott and White Hospital) into an outstanding surgical center. Dr. Potter excelled in her medical speciality and was widely respected. She retired from Scott and White in 1947 after 41 years of service, and died in 1970.

Cole finished high school and attended Lon Morris College for a year before enrolling at Scott & White School of Nursing in 1928. After graduating in 1931 as valedictorian, Cole was appointed assistant director of nursing education and then named as a nursing school instructor. In 1933, she became the director of both the nursing school and nursing services for the hospital and clinic at a difficult time for the medical institution and for the profession of nursing. Devastated by the depression, Scott & White weathered many cutbacks while trying to maintain quality medical and nursing care. In 1933, Texas was experiencing a nursing shortage with one registered nurse for every 1,033 persons. Despite the pressures of her post, Cole earned her bachelor of nursing education from the University of Texas Medical Branch in 1940, the first to receive a diploma in the new baccalaureate program. After WWII, Cole was instrumental in efforts to enhance nursing education and served on the state board of nurse examiners and the board of vocational nurse examiners. Under her guidance, schools of vocational nursing opened, training and licensing vocational nurses under the highest standards. In addition to Cole’s administration of the Scott & White Nursing School and her position on numerous medical and educational boards, Cole supervised a nursing dorm on campus and mentored many student nurses over the years. Cole retired in 1969 after 38 years with Scott & White and, over the course of her career, trained nearly 870 nurses. The foundations laid by Cole remain firm in the nursing profession, Bell county and across the state. (2013) Image credit: www.findagrave.com]]></description>

She was the daughter of Augustine and Julia Tyrrell De Zavala, and the granddaughter of Lorenzo De Zavala, first Vice-President of the Republic of Texas. Adina spent her early years in Galveston, before moving with her family to a ranch near San Antonio circa 1873. Miss Adina was a founding member of "De Zavala's Daughters," one of the earliest preservation groups in the state of Texas. Among de Zavala's most renowned contributions to the preservation of Texas history was hre role in saving the Alamo Long Barracks from demolition. De Zavala not only secured funding from philanthropist Clara Driscoll for the purchase of the structure, but she also barricaded herself inside the military quarters in February of 1907 when she feared the building was to be razed. Besides her dedication to saving portions of the Alamo compound, De Zavala initiated a public effort that culminated in protecting several of Texas' most revered historic structures and sites, including the legendary missions and Spanish Governors' Palace in Bexar County, and Mission San Francisco de los Tejas in east Texas. In 1938, De Zavala organized the Texas Historical and Landmarks Association. The civic group installed thirty-eight markers at historic sites thorughout Texas. Two months after her death in 1955, the Texas Legislature honored Adina De Zavala for her "life of devotion to Texas history, folklore, and general civic and patriotic work," as well as her commitment to "immortalizing Texas history for the ages."

In 1903, soon after returning from school in Europe, she learned that the Long Barrack, part of the historic Alamo, was about to be sold as a hotel site. When the state failed to act, she bought the property, using her own funds to supplement money raised by the Daughters of the Republic of Texas. Her gesture sparked public interest and won her the title "Savior of the Alamo." The state reimbursed her in 1905 and placed the Alamo in the care of the DRT. In 1932 she helped the state buy land south of the Alamo Chapel. Clara Driscoll was active in business, politics, and the arts. She headed several state organizations, including the Daughters of the Republic of Texas, and served as Democratic National Committeewoman, 1928-44. She gave generously to support the Texas Federation of Women's Clubs, the Texas Fine Arts Association, and medical services for underprivileged children. Married to newspaperman Henry H. Seveir, 1906-37, she lived in Austin before moving to Corpus Christi to manage family properties. After she died, her body lay in state in the Alamo Chapel before burial here.

As a child, Tenayuca had often visited the Plaza Del Zacate (now Milam Park), where residents gathered to discuss politics and civil issues in the days before Spanish radio programming. These visits awakened in her awareness of injustice, and she converted her concern into action. Tenayuca joined the Workers Alliance of America and other activist political organizations because of their philosophy in favor of workers' rights. As a gifted and compassionate orator, she organized and participated in many demonstrations in support of San Antonio workers. In 1938, Tenayuca led thousands of pecan shellers, most of whom were Hispanic women, to walk off the job in protest of proposed pay cuts. San Antonio served as the center of the U.S. shelling industry, and typical salaries ranged from only two to three dollars per week. The strike was one of the first successful actions in the Mexican-American struggle for political and social justice. Unable to find work in Texas in part because of her political activities, Tenayuca relocated to California in 1945, where she earned an undergraduate degree. She returned quietly to San Antonio in the late 1960s, and earned a master's degree and worked as a reading teacher at Harlandale I.S.D. in South Bexar County until her retirement in 1982. Tenayuca died in 1999, leaving behind a legacy of courage and compassion. (2009)  Image credit: Wikipedia.org]]></description>

        <name>Mabel Welch</name>
        <description>Mabel C. (Vanderburg) Welch, El Paso’s first certified female architect, is credited with reintroducing Spanish-style architecture to the city. Early El Paso residents built with adobe bricks, a method common to the region. After the arrival of the railroad in 1881, El Paso grew into a thriving city, and this regional architecture disappeared, replaced by styles and building techniques that reflected the traditions and experiences of those who settled here. Within four years of their 1916 arrival in El Paso, Mabel and Malcolm Welch began designing and constructing homes. When Malcolm was hospitalized with tuberculosis, Mabel completed the construction of a home that her husband had begun. She subsequently assumed the entire design and construction process for his other projects, and continued to work on her own after his death. Through 1926 and into early 1927, Mabel designed and built nine houses in the 3100 block of Wheeling Ave. Trips across the southwest during this period introduced Mabel to the Spanish archtectural style, which she believed was more in keeping with the Spanish-Indian heritage of El Paso than the red brick bungalows that lined the city’s streets. Upon her return she designed exclusively in the Spanish Colonial Revival style. Welch continued her work in El Paso and throughout the region into the early 1950s. Examples are located in the Manhattan Heights historic district, the Castle Heights addition and along Rim Road. The state of Texas certified Welch as an architect in 1939. She designed as many as 1,500 homes in El Paso and across the southwest during her career. (2009)</description>

        <name>Estéfana Goseascochea Cemetery</name>
        <description>María Estéfana Goseascochea de Cavazos y de Cortina established this burial ground on her property by the mid-1800s. Doña Estéfana, as she was known, was a large landowner and matriarch of noted pioneer families in south Texas. Born in Ciudad Camargo, Nuevo Santander, Mexico in 1792 to an affluent family, she married José María Fransisco Cavazos in 1815. The couple had three children before José died. In 1823, Estéfana remarried; with attorney and alcalde Trinidad Cortinas she would have three more children. Cortinas died during the Mexican-American war (1846-48). In 1848, Doña Estéfana moved her family from Camargo, Mexico to her allotted portion of the Espíritu Santo grant, located here. She established a ranching community that she named Rancho el Carmen (El Carmen Ranch), building a house and chapel. While here, Doña Estéfana lost a portion of her land to robber barons, despite a court ruling in her favor. One of Estéfana’s sons, Juan N. Cortina, was a noted general and notorious figure who championed her cause in south Texas. Doña Estéfana died on Nov. 10, 1867, and was buried at the cemetery on Rancho el Carmen. Due to damage from weather and vandalism, and obstruction from the building of a levee, the burial ground has diminished. However, it remains a monument to the residents of this area and to Doña Estéfana, who was praised after her death by the Brownsville Daily Ranchero, which stated, “many are living who owe their lives to the noble exertions of Doña Estéfana. Her sympathies were ever aroused in behalf of those whose lives were endangered, her philanthropy knew no bounds.” Historic Texas cemetery – 2007</description>

Born Olga Bernstein in Elberfeld, Westphalia (Germany) in 1864, she was raised in an upper-middle class German-Jewish family. She moved to El Paso in 1884 after marrying Ernst Kohlberg, a prominent El Paso businessman who emigrated from Germany to the united states in 1875. They had four children. In 1891, Olga co-organized the child culture study circle and in 1894 the current topics club, forerunners of the El Paso Woman’s Club, which was founded in 1898. She served as president of the Woman’s Club twice and remained an honorary board member for the rest of her life. In the 1890s, she played a leading role in the establishment of a free public kindergarten in El Paso, the first in Texas. She was instrumental in the construction of the El Paso Public Library and the formation of the Ladies’ Benevolent Association. During the following decades, she was a leading member of many other public health and charity organizations, including the Charity Union, Health League, Women’s Charity Association, associated charities and the Cloudcroft Baby Sanatorium. She also played a key role in the establishment of El Paso’s Mount Sinai Jewish congregation in 1898 and the construction of Temple Mount Sinai in 1903. Olga Kohlberg’s activism was shaped by the social traditions of reformed Judaism and by the progressive era’s focus on public education, health and welfare. Her tireless efforts on behalf of the community made her one of El Paso’s most admired and beloved reformers.  (2013)   Image credit: www.elpasotimes.com]]></description>

        <name>Sarah Ridge Paschal Pix</name>
        <description><![CDATA[Born on the family plantation in the Cherokee Nation near present Rome, Georgia, Sarah Ridge (1814-1891) attended mission schools and girls' seminary. Her father Major Ridge was a Cherokee leader and friend of Sam Houston. Major Ridge, Sarah's brother John, and cousin were later assassinated for supporting the treaty which traded Indian lands for acreage in the West. This treaty led to the infamous "Trail of Tears." Sarah married a lawyer, George Washington Paschal, in 1837 and they settled in Arkansas. In 1847 the family and slaves moved to Galveston. During the 1850 yellow fever epidemic Sarah opened her home and treated many of the ill with an Indian remedy. After Sarah and Paschal were divorced, she married Charles C. Sisson Pix, an Englishman, in 1856 in the home of Republic of Texas President Mirabeau B. Lamar. Sarah traded her Galveston home for this land of Smith Point soon after her marriage. Pix cattle ranged from here to present Liberty. While Pix served in the Confederate Army, Sarah built the ranch into a large operation. With the end of slavery, the ranch declined. After Sarah divorced Pix in 1880, she remained on the ranch with her widowed daughter Agnes Paschal McNeir and two grandsons. Heirs still own the land. (1979)]]></description>

        <name>Carver Homestead</name>
        <description>In 1838, Mary Beacham received a headright land grant of one league and one labor (about 4600 acres), including this property, making her first in a line of notable women associated with the site. Following multiple ownership transfers, Eliphas Spencer acquired the land and built a two-room log cabin in Dec. 1845. Eliphas later transferred title to his wife, Catherine, whom he married in 1847. The Spencers raised their only child, Emmeline, in the house. Fort Graham (active 1849-54, six miles NW) afforded some protection for the frontier house. Eliphas died in 1860. Surviving letters between Catherine and distant family speak of economic, health and communication problems, and of scarce and expensive commodities. Colmon Carver, who visited the house in 1860, hauled supplies including salt, coffee and flour for the confederate government during the civil war. Carver returned and married Emmeline in 1868. In 1875, the Spencer cabin was incorporated as a kitchen into a larger victorian-style home. Four years later, the Houston and Texas Central Railroad platted the town of Whitney on land west of the Carver property. Catherine lived with her daughter and son-in-law until her death in 1882. The Carvers owned thousands of acres all across Texas. Colmon Carver died in 1911. Emmeline and her son, Charles, hired John E. Bruyere of Waco to add a second story in 1912, creating a Neoclassical style house with full-height entry porch and lower full-length porch. Emmeline Carver died in 1936. Later owners included former Whitney mayor Fred Basham and his wife, Jennye Mae. After a 1971 tornado destroyed chimneys and 18 windows, the Bashams made repairs and added a small rear addition. The historic homestead includes a carriage house, slave quarters, henhouse, and outhouse, all of frame construction, and a smokehouse/pantry of native limestone.

Her mother, Mary Alice Jones Porter, died in 1892, and her father, Harrison Boone Porter (1858-1942) returned with the children to his native Hays County to live with his mother, Catherine Ann Skaggs Porter (1826-1901). Porter spent her childhood in Kyle and attended the public schools here. Following a brief failed marriage, she left Texas in 1915. She went to Chicago and, using the name she adopted from her grandmother, became a journalist. She traveled throughout the world and began her writing career. Porter's first book of short stories, "Flowering Judas and Other Stories," was published in 1930. Considered a preeminent writer of short stories, she published another collection, "Pale Horse, Pale Rider" in 1939. Her acclaimed 1962 novel "Ship of Fools" was followed by the Pulitzer prize-winning "The Collected Stores of Katherine Anne Porter" in 1965. Porter returned to Texas to visit her former homes in her later years and, according to her request, upon her death her ashes were interred next to her mother's grave in the Indian Creek Cemetery.

        <name>The Library Movement in Marshall</name>
        <description>Twenty-five Marshall ladies formed the Ingleside Circulating Book Club in 1887, each member buying a book and making exchanges. When that club and four others organized a federation in 1899, their first civic goal was a city library. Use of a feed store loft was donated by the federation president and her husband. The library opened in 1900 with 174 books and with hay-bales for chairs. After a charter was obtained Oct. 24, 1902, the library moved to the City Hall, where it operated until a 1923 fire. At the City Hall, $1-a-year reading tickets gave admission to the public. these tickets plus funds raised by the clubwomen provided 69 years of city library services without the use of public tax revenues. This graceful Georgian structure was built after the clubs worked on funding for over 20 years and after the City Hall fire. Erected in 1926 at cost of $34,046.93, it was ideal in its appointments at that time, but was later outgrown. Finally the city was persuaded to support a municipal library, and on Oct. 28, 1971, the clubwomen handed over the keys to their building, books, and furniture. On completion of a new, larger city library facility in 1973, this building came to house other civic endeavors. (1976)</description>

        <description>Elizabeth (Ann) Whitney, a native of Missouri, accepted a teaching position at a newly erected rural school located about seven miles north of present day Hamilton in 1867. This school, called the Leon River School, was situated on a rise overlooking the Warlene Valley. On a hot summer afternoon in 1867 Ann and her students were suddenly attacked by Comanche Indians. According to local tradition Ann was repeatedly struck by arrows fired through cracks in the schoolhouse walls. Although fatally injured she nevertheless bravely aided the escape of all but one of her young students. (1992)</description>

        <name>Angel of Goliad</name>
        <description><![CDATA[Amid the cruelties of the Texas war for independence, one notable woman committed acts of bravery and compassion. Francisca Alavez (also known by similar names) accompanied Mexican Army Captain Telesforo Alavez to Texas in March 1836. In seven incidents between March and April, she intervened with Mexican troops under command of Gen. José de Urrea to help captured Texian prisoners at Agua Dulce, Copano, La Bahia, Victoria and Matamoros. On Mar. 20, Maj. William P. Miller and 75 men of his Nashville Battalion were captured as they unloaded their ship at Copano Bay. Alavez insisted that binding cords which cut off circulation be removed and food and water be provided. The men were moved to Presidio La Bahia at Goliad, where hundreds of Col. James Fannin's troops were already held after their capture at Coleto Creek. At least 342 men were taken out of the fort on Mar. 27 and shot under orders of Gen. Santa Anna in what was termed the Goliad Massacre. Alavez helped save the lives of many men, including 16-year-old Benjamin Hughes. Another Survivor, Dr. J.H. Barnard, recalled that she pleaded for their lives, helped sneak out some troops at night and hid some of the men. Her humanitarian acts included tending to wounds and sending messages and provisions to those still imprisoned. The Texas Centennial of 1936 revived interest in Alavez with articles, a play, and a bronze bust and historical mural for Goliad's Memorial Auditorium. Additional commemorations, such as a resolution from the Texas Legislature in 2001, have helped confirm Dr. Barnard's assertion that "her name deserves to be recorded in letters of gold among those angels who have from time to time been commissioned by an overruling and beneficent power to relieve the sorrows and cheer the hearts of men."

        <name>Powhatan and Mattie Wren House</name>
        <description><![CDATA[In 1873, Edward Sylvester paid W.C. Crookshank to build a side-gabled cottage with galleries that ran the length of the north and south sides of the house. Originally, there was a small building at the back of the lot most likely used as a kitchen. Sylvester and his wife Lydia lived in the house for several years before they sold it to Powhatan and Matite (Campbell) Wren.Powhatan Wren was born in Powhatan County, Virginia in 1842 and moved to Galveston by 1867. He worked for the Galveston, Houston & Harrisburg Railroad as a freight agent, and later as a city clerk and county clerk, and as chief clerk of the U.S. Customs House. To make his home large enough for his family, which included six children, Wren hired Robert B. Garrett in 1885 to enlarge, remodel and update the house with Victorian details to its present form. The house has kept its appearance since that time.The 1900 hurricane obliterated most of the neighborhoods between Broadway and the Gulf of Mexico, but this house survived. After the city completed construction on the first section of the seawall in 1904, workers raised the house so fill could be pumped under the structure. The house remained in the family until 1921, then passed through a series of owners and divided into a duplex in the 1930s, when leaseholders began to open businesses in the lower level. The structure remained rental property through many of the subsequent years. Located in Galveston’s historic East End, the eclectic styled house features a side-gabled roof, shiplap wood siding, a gallery porch and central door with sidelights.

        <description><![CDATA[Born in Maryland in 1798, Jane H. Wilkinson moved to Mississippi (1811) and became the ward of her famous relative, Gen. James Wilkinson, field commander of the United States Army. Jane married Dr. James Long in 1815 and later followed him on a filibustering expedition to free Texas from Spain. In 1821 Long led his forces into battle, leaving Jane alone with their daughter Ann and slave girl Kian at Point Bolivar, near Galveston. On Dec. 21, 1821, with snow falling, their food supply gone, and Kian ill, Jane gave birth to a daughter, then rose and got food and firewood for her family. Her heroism earned her the name "Mother of Texas." Later she learned of her husband's death in Mexico. During the period Texas was a colony and a republic, Jane Long operated two well-known boarding houses. She started the first in Brazoria in 1832; her guests included William B. Travis, Sam Houston, and Mirabeau B. Lamar. In 1837 Jane moved to Richmond and on this site opened another boarding house which became a center for social and political activities as well as lodging for prominent Texans and European visitors. Jane ran this hotel until her plantation near town became prosperous in the 1840s. She died in 1880 and is buried in richmond's Morton Cemetery. (1975)]]></description>

Originated with a 6-acre plot willed to Texas in 1916 by Mrs. Isabella E. Neff, mother of Pat M. Neff, Governor of Texas (1921-1925) Because Texas then had no state parks, Mrs. Neff stated the land was to be used for religious, fraternal, political, and educational activities. Seeing the need for more such areas, in 1923, the 39th Legislature created the State Parks Board. In 1934 Pat Neff deeded 250 acres, and other owners 3 acres, to enlarge the original tract.

Traveling by way of the Devils River and Beaver Lake, they migrated to this area with two children and 200 head of longhorn cattle. Their first home, constructed of cedar pickets, was located under a bluff overlooking the Pecos River. The Hoovers had fourteen children, five of whom died in infancy. Isolated, the family had to be self-sufficient, since supply trips to the nearest towns, over 75 miles away, took several days. Laura and William Hoover steadily acquired land and their holdings grew to over 100,000 acres. Their cattle were identified by the "Hoo" brand. The Hoovers later moved to present-day Ozona (50 miles northeast) and became active in the development of the community. William was instrumental in the formation of Crockett County and helped organize the Ozona National Bank. 100 years after the Hoovers settled in this area, much of their land is still owned by descendants.

In 1872, Texas passed a state medical practice act but failed to mention the pediatric specialty. As late as 1885, Dallas’ only public hospital facility was a small frame building on Lamar Street, known as City Hospital. By 1897, Reverend R.C. Buckner established a private children’s hospital dedicated solely to the care of children in association with Buckner’s orphan home in Dallas but had to close soon after for financial reasons. From 1904 to 1913, May Forster Smith, a private-duty nurse, worked at area hospitals. Seeing the plight of poor infants suffering from dehydration and other maladies, may invited her fellow nurses to a meeting to identify a solution. Smith and her colleagues convinced the Dallas Graduate Nurses Association in 1913 to endorse and form a baby camp to treat small infants. The first baby camp in the southwest and third in the country opened on April 6, 1913 on the campus of the Parkland Hospital and was originally housed in four tents supplied by the American Red Cross. The city’s leadership quickly realized the continued need for the camp and relocated the facilities in 1914 to a small cottage on the hospital grounds. Due to the generosity of charitable organizations, the camp continued to provide care to infants and educate new mothers in infant care. In 1929, T. L. Bradford donated the funds to build a larger facility on Maple Avenue. In 1947, the baby camp, Bradford Hospital, Children’s Hospital, and Freeman Clinic came together as Children’s Medical Center of Dallas, one of the largest pediatric providers in the nation.

Established to train Texas National Guard and Oklahoma National Guard, after the U.S. entered World War I April 1917. Named for James Bowie (1795-1836), one of the commanders who died at the Alamo in Texas War for Independence, Camp Bowie was occupied in July 1917. First troops to arrive slept in deep Johnson grass that covered the site, an undeveloped suburb. By Nov. 1917, the 36th Division had 25,000 men here, and on July 8, 1918, they were shipped to France, to form reserve for French Armies of the Center. After nightfall, Oct. 6, the 36th occupied a segment of the fighting front; on Oct. 8 joined by elements of the U.S. 2nd Division, it captured St. Etienne-A-Arnes. It fought Oct. 10-28 in the Meuse-Argonne operation that shattered the German Army and assured victory to the Allies, bringing Armistice on Nov. 11, 1918. The 36th Division, embarking for home the next May, had all its men on U.S. soil by June 11, 1919. Soon demobilized, it saw its "Home" at Camp Bowie revert to civilian uses between July 1919 and Aug. 1920. When the Texas National Guard entered World War II its new camp at Brownwood was also named Bowie. (1973)]]></description>

Immediately thereafter, eight camps were established in the U.S. to train officers for combat leadership. The first was at Leon Springs, Texas, and on May 8, 1917, three thousand volunteers assembled at Camp Funston on the Schasse Ranch (now a part of Camp Bullis near this site) for training in various branches of the army. They endured three months of intense training and 1,846 young men graduated on August 15, 1917, as second lieutenants. The length of their training resulted in the term "90-day wonders."<br> Embodying their motto ""brave men shall not die because I faltered,"" the members of the first officers training camp served with distinction in the war, many of them highly decorated for valor in combat. Almost 300, many highly ranking colonels or generals, returned to active duty for service in World War II. Three of those trained here later became governors: Beauford Jester of Texas, James R. Beverley of Puerto Rico, and Charles H. Martin of Oregon. Many more "first campers" were prominent leaders in business, industry and government throughout Texas and the United States.<br> Following their training and service, the former comrades in arms organized the "First Officers Training Camp Association" in 1931. Members residing in 30 states and several foreign countries gathered for annual meetings for more than fifty years. Now succeeded by generations of modern soldiers and officers, the First Officers Training Camp veterans leave a legacy of honor, courage and service to their country.

In his search for a new army aviation training site, Maj. Benjamin Foulois found 700 acres of flat farmland with a water supply near the Missouri-Pacific rail line, then seven miles south of San Antonio. With the help of U.S. Senator Morris Sheppard of Texas, the site was acquired and cleared. Aviation operations began here on April 5, 1917, the day before the United States declared war on Germany. Kelly Field, named for George Edward Maurice Kelly, the first military pilot killed in a plane crash at nearby Fort Sam Houston in 1911, trained aviators, mechanics and support personnel for war duty. After additional land was acquired, the field was divided into Kelly Number 1 (later renamed Duncan Field) and Kelly Number 2. The Air Service Advanced Flying School, which headquartered at Kelly Number 2, trained pilots including Charles Lindbergh, Curtis LeMay and numerous future Air Force chiefs of staff. During World War II, Kelly saw a tremendous increase in its civilian and military workforce, including women, who were known as "Kelly Katies." After the Air Force became an independent military service in 1947, the field became known as Kelly Air Force Base. Personnel at Kelly were significantly involved with air transport and maintenance during the Korean conflict, the Cold War, Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Once the largest employer in San Antonio, Kelly Air Force Base realigned in 2001 in response to peacetime defense spending cuts. (2001) Image source: hmdb.org]]></description>

Benjamin Foulois of the Aviation Section of the U.S. Army's Signal Corps chose a tract of land approximately three-fourths of a mile to the southeast of this spot to serve as a flying field for the Army Aviation Corps. In 1917, the site was named Camp Kelly and later Kelly Field in honor of Lt. George E.M. Kelly, who in 1911 had become the first American aviator to lose his life while piloting a military aircraft. Activities at the camp included both flight training and aircraft maintenance. In September 1917, Kelly Field's training activities moved north to this area, called "Kelly No. 2" to distinguish it from the original field.<br><br>The new flight line, extending 125 yards east and 2400 yards west of this site, consisted of numerous hangars, warehouses, barracks, repair shops, classrooms, and maintenance buildings. "Kelly No. 2" retained its training function from 1917 through 1942. Its Air Corps Advanced Flying School produced many prominent American aviators, including Charles Lindbergh and Claire Chennault. In 1955, the advent of new and larger aircraft prompted the extension of the existing runway, this necessitating the demolition of the old "Kelly No. 2" flight line.

Alabama native Katherine Stinson (1891-1977), hoping to win prize money to finance her musical education, convinced famed flight instructor Max Lillie of Chicago to take her on as a student in 1912. She became the fourth licensed woman pilot in the U. S. and began touring as a stunt pilot. Her family - mother Emma, sister Marjorie, and brothers Eddie and Jack- established the Stinson Aviation Company in Hot Springs, Arkansas. Marjorie and Eddie trained at the Wright Flying School in Ohio and also became pilots.<br> In 1913, Max Lillie encouraged the Stinsons to move to San Antonio where the army had granted him permission to use the parade ground at Fort Sam Houston. Soon Katherine and Marjorie were offering instruction to U. S. and Canadian military pilots. The family leased 500 acres at this site from the city in 1916 and established Stinson Field. After the ban of civilian flights during World War I, Stinson Field became the city's civil airport in 1918. Charles Lindbergh kept an airplane and flew out of Stinson while he was stationed at Brooks Field. In the 1930s, commercial airlines began using the airport and construction of a new terminal building with Works Progress Administration funds enhanced the facility. During World War II it once again became an Army Air Corps training facility. Returned to civilian use after the war, Stinson Field became the primary general aviation airport for the city of San Antonio. (2001) Image source: sanantonio.gov/ssf]]></description>

R.H. K. Whiteley. Construction began in 1859 under the supervision of contractors John Me. and W.W. Campbell. Three buildings were under construction at the beginning of the Civil War: The magazine, office building, and Armorer's shop. After U.S. commander Gen. David E. Twiggs surrendered all federal property in the city to state forces commanded by Ben McCulloch in 1861, construction was continued by confederate forces. During the war the Arsenal served as a principal supply depot for troops in South Texas and on the western frontier. In November 1865 federal troops reoccupied this complex and assumed control of all military installations in the area. Construction of additional buildings continued after 1873, and this became a central supply point for U.S. troops in the southwest. In 1877 and 1883 buildings were added, and changes were made to existing structures. During World War I another building expansion program occurred,and by 1920 the compound consisted of forty-four buildings. The San Antonio Arsenal was deactivated by the U.S. Army in 1947.

The students at what was then an all-male institution were required to serve in the corps and follow military discipline. At the center of the Corps and campus activity was the Main Drill Field, where cadets drilled and practiced maneuvers before and after classes.<br> The site of horse-drawn artillery and infantry exercises, as well as student pilot training in the 1920s, the open parade ground also served as the university's early football field prior to construction of a permanent field in 1905. The Aggie Bonfire was held on the Main Drill Field from 1909 until 1955, and students assembled for drills and graduation activities, including the Corps' Final Review.<br> In 1920, A&M's Board of Directors paid tribute to former cadets killed during World War I by planting oak trees around the field. Markers at each tree provided the name, class and site and date of death for each man. The classes of 1923, 1924, 1925 and 1926 placed a granite memorial to the war casualties on the west side of the drill field, which was later named for A&M distinguished alumni Lieutenant General Ormond R. Simpson, a 1936 mechanical engineering graduate of the university. After serving in World War II, Korea and Vietnam, Simpson retired in 1972 and became A&M's Assistant Vice-President for Student Services and head of the School of Military Sciences. He served at the university until retiring in 1985, the year the field was named in his honor.<br> A&M's Main Drill Field is a testament to the school's beginnings as a military and academic institution, as well as a symbol of Aggies' service to their state and nation.

Records show that Tilton came to Texas about 1829. He married Anna Barber, the 15-year-old daughter of Samuel and Elizabeth Barrow Barber, in 1831. They made their home in this area.<br> Tilton fought in the Texas revolution, returning home during the "Runaway Scrape" to ensure the safety of his family. In 1838 he was granted a headright including 1,496 acres of land near this site. The Tilton family lived for a time on Matagorda Peninsula, where they named their home Tiltona and Charles engaged in shipping and cattle ventures. The land speculator and Congressman Samuel Maverick adapted his brand from Tilton's when he bought Tiltona and 400 heard of cattle in 1847. The Tilton family returned to Chambers County that same year.<br> Between 1853 and 1860, Michael Chavenoe, a veteran of the Battle of San Jacinto and a Tilton family friend, died while visiting the family. Charles and Anna Tilton set aside an acre of land for a family cemetery at that time. Charles Tilton died in 1861 while in Galveston attending to his freight hauling business. He was interred here on Christmas Day. Anna Tilton died in 1883 and was buried beside her husband. Charles and Anna's nine children and their descendants continued to use the family graveyard. Veterans of the Texas revolution, the Civil War, World War I, World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War are interred here. Cared for by Tilton descendants, the cemetery remains as a chronicle of early Texas pioneers. (1999) Image source: geni.com]]></description>

In 1906, his parents, Young Yancy and Ladonia (Graham) Eaker, moved the family to the Eden area, where he and his brothers attended school. Eaker enlisted in the army on April 7, 1917, one day after the U.S. declared war on Germany. He was recruited into the army's early aviation program and continued his pilot training through the war, after which he commanded a squadron in the Philippines. There he helped devise an aircraft level instrument, which was further developed by the Air Corps Materiel Division. <br> <br>In 1926-27, Eaker served as a pilot in the Pan American Goodwill tour. He also conceived and tested innovative flight procedures. During the 1930s, he earned a journalism degree and graduated from the Army Command and General Staff School in Kansas. At the outbreak of World War II, Eaker was sent to England to organize and oversee the U.S. 8th Army Air Force Bomber Command, coordinating efforts with the Royal Air Force in round-the-clock bombing of Germany's war works. He sometimes accompanied his men, believing a commander should know what his troops face in combat. He commanded the 8th Army Air Force and later the Mediterranean Allied Air Forces. Near war's end, he served at the Pentagon as Deputy Commanding General of the Army Air Forces. <br> <br>Eaker retired in 1947 and worked for Howard Hughes and then for Douglas Aircraft Company, from which he retired in 1961. He launched a newspaper column a few years later and involved himself in military commentary for the rest of his life. Remembering his foundation in Eden and his Eden classmates, he returned here often for family and community events. The recipient of more than 50 awards and decorations, including knighthood in England and a U.S. Congressional Gold Medal as "aviation pioneer and air power leader," he died August 6, 1987.

Used by the 1st Aero Squadron in support of the Punitive Expedition into Mexico, 1916-17, Fort Bliss Field became home to the Border Air Patrol, 1919-21. On January 5, 1925, the War Department renamed it for James B. "Buster" Biggs, a native El Pasoan and World War I fighter pilot killed in France in 1918. In 1926, six years after activation of the 8th Airship Company, the field relocated to Camp Owen Bierne, north of the Fort Bliss cantonment area.<br><br> During World War II, the Army expanded the runway and added new facilities on adjacent land east of Camp Bierne. With the improvements, Biggs Field became an important training base and headquarters for the 20th Bombardment Command of the Second Air Force. It also served as a key transient point for new aircraft en route from West Coast factories to the European Theater.<br><br> With the establishment of the U.S. Air Force as a separate military branch in 1947, Biggs Field became Biggs Air Force Base on February 1, 1948. The arrival of the 97th Bomb Wing marked its inclusion into the Strategic Air Command, resulting in the need for further expansion.<br><br> Declared inactive as an Air Force base in 1966, Biggs once again came under U.S. Army command, and it is the largest of the Army's airfields. Capable of accommodating all aircraft, Biggs Army Airfield has supported National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) space shuttle ferry flights since 1979. Today, through a variety of aviation activities, the airfield continues to support military operations at Fort Bliss. (2006) Image source: airfieldsdatabase.com]]></description>

Using army recruits and slave labor Harcourt built an octagonal earth and timber fortification armed with six and twelve-pound gun mounts appropriated from the Texas Navy vessel CAYUGA. Named Fort Travis in honor of William B. Travis, famous defender of the Alamo, it was located at the east end of the island. After high winds damaged the fort in 1837 the site was converted into a gun battery called Fort point, its present name.<br> In 1898-99, with the beginning of Federal development of the Port of Galveston, a second Fort Travis was established across Galveston Bay at Bolivar Point near the former site of a Civil War Confederate fortification called Fort Green. Two batteries, named Davis and Ernst, were completed in 1899 and a third, named Kimble, completed in 1922. Coastal defense facilities were added to the fort during World Wars I and II. Fort Travis was decommissioned and sold as war surplus in 1949. Besides its obvious military uses, Fort Travis also served as a refuge from hurricanes and as a Civil Defense shelter for area residents.<br> Incise on back: Funding for this replacement marker was provided through a generous grant from the Hoblitzelle Foundation and the Texas Historical Foundation.

It was built in Mobile, Alabama, and named to honor Selma, Alabama, for its successful wartime liberty loan drive.<br> The ship was launched on June 28, 1919, the same day Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles, officially ending World War I. As a result, the 7,500-ton ship never entered the war, but instead was placed into service as an oil tanker in the Gulf of Mexico.<br> In Tampico, Mexico, on May 31, 1920, the SS Selma hit a jetty, ripping a hole in its hull about 60 feet long. After attempts to repair the ship in Galveston failed and efforts to sell the ship proved unsuccessful, U. s. officials decided to intentionally scuttle the ship. A channel 1,500 feet long and 25 feet deep was dug to a point just off Pelican Island's eastern shoreline where on March 9, 1922, the ship was laid to rest.<br> The Selma has since been the object of failed plans to convert it for use as a fishing pier, pleasure resort, and oyster farm. Long a source of curiosity and local legend, it remains important to scientists who continued to study aspects of its concrete construction. Image source: pixdaus.com]]></description>

S. Army established 34 training camps to prepare troops for warfare. Named for Gen. John A. Logan, Mexican War and Civil War veteran and U. S. Senator from Illinois, Camp Logan was established at this site on July 18, 1917. Encompassing 7,600 acres of land, it consisted of a main camp, auxiliary remount depot, rifle range, artillery range, and drill grounds.<br> During construction, members of the 3rd Battalion, 24th Infantry (black troops commanded by white officers) were assigned to the camp as guards and were stationed about a mile to the east. The black soldiers' August 23, 1917, armed revolt in response to Houston's Jim Crow laws and police harassment resulted in the camp's most publicized incident, the "Houston Mutiny and Riot of 1917."<br> Troops receiving training at Camp Logan included the 33rd Division, composed of the Illinois National Guard, part of the 93rd Division, and other Regular Army units. Following training, they went on to serve in battle in France in 1918.<br> Camp Logan closed on March 20, 1919. Part of the land later became Memorial Park, named in tribute to the soldiers who fought in Europe. Image source: usgwarchives.net]]></description>

Named for Lt. Eric Lamar Ellington, an Illinois aviator killed in a California plane crash in 1913, it opened in November 1917.<br> The site transferred to the National Guard during the 1920s, and following a fire and demolition, all that remained by the 1930s was a concrete water tank. The government retained ownership, leasing the site for grazing cattle. By the 1940s, the threat of another world conflict caused the U.S. to reactivate the base. Ellington was vital to American war planning during World War II due to its strategic location near oil refineries and the Houston Ship Channel. Construction began in 1940, and among the first improvements was a service apron believed to be the largest concrete slab in the world at the time. Troops began arriving at the modernized facility in April 1941.<br> Ellington was primarily a pilot training center, but navigators and bombardiers, as well as aviators from other countries, also trained here. Because the field was operational prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941, one of every ten Army pilots went through its flying school in the first two years of the war. Later, the Army Air Force ran an advanced navigator training school here.<br> After the war, Ellington was home to a Texas Air National Guard unit. During the Cold War, it again became an active Air Force base, primarily for navigator training. The Air Force abandoned the base in 1976, and the site has since been shared by the Texas Air National Guard, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Texas Army Guard, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the City of Houston, which, since 1984, has used much of it for a municipal airport.<br><br>Texas in World War II, V+60 (2005) Image source: flickr.com]]></description>

South of the railroad tracks were parade grounds, tent encampments, and stock pens. The camp was abandoned in March 1917, one month before the U.S. entered World War I, and former Llano Grande troops were called for war service in France.<br><br>Texas Sesquicentennial 1836 - 1986 Image source: waymarking.com]]></description>

The 3-5 day encampment, held annually from 1902 to 1924, was an important social and recreational event in this locality. Many families traveled by wagon and camped at the site. Special trains from Hillsboro brought other visitors, and a gravel auto road was completed in 1909. The reunion usually attracted a crowd of several thousand persons. Activities included speeches, musical programs, baseball games, and, on one occasion, a carnival midway show.<br> Located on the grounds were a spring-fed lake, large pavilion, and baseball park. Some families leased their camp lots and built summer cottages. The fraternal picnic association's July 4th picnic, 1908-14, and other meetings and social events were also held here.<br> With the reopening (1916) of the Hill County Fair and a decrease in numbers of veterans and old settlers, reunion attendance dropped sharply at the end of World War I (1918). The association deeded its property to the state in 1924 to be developed as Jefferson Davis State Park, but those plans were never realized. Image source: waymarking.com]]></description>

Through separate confinement programs, thousands of Japanese, German, and Italian citizens in the U.S. (and in many cases, their U.S. citizen relatives), classified as enemy aliens, were detained by the Department of Justice (DOJ) through its Enemy Alien Control Unit, and, in Latin America, by the Department of State’s Special War Problems division. Enemy aliens were held until paroled or exchanged for U.S. and allied citizens seized overseas by axis nations.<br> Texas hosted three DOJ confinement sites, administered by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) at Crystal City, Seagoville, and here, as well as two U.S. army temporary detention stations at Fort Sam Houston and Fort Bliss. Previously camp Kenedy served as a World War I training camp and later as a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp. In March 1942, the site transferred from the CCC to the INS. <br> On April 21, 1942, the confinement site’s first detainees arrived––primarily adult males from Latin American republics. The site had accommodations for 1,200 internees and a staff of 84; however, the population averaged closer to 600 internees per month. Detainees had access to large athletic fields and a garden outside the fence. <br> The INS ceased operation of the facility in September 1944 and the remaining internees were transferred to other camps, paroled, or repatriated. After the enemy alien detention station closed the site became a German, and later a Japanese enemy prisoner of war camp.<br><br>Texas in World War II – 2013 image source: thc.state.tx.us]]></description>

During World War I, he was an aerial observer and pilot in the 24th Aero Squadron, First Army Observation Group. After the war, he established San Antonio Aviation and Motor School at Stinson field. In 1925, he bought 251 surplus Curtiss airplanes and a hangar at Love Field and moved his flight training school there as Dallas Aviation School and Air College. Never idle, Long, sometimes referred to as “Mr. Love Field,” built a new airfield, Curtiss-Wright Field, with partners in 1929 at Grand Prairie.<br> In 1939, Long attended Gen. “Hap” Arnold’s Washington, D. C. briefing on the use of civilian contract schools to train u. S. Army pilot cadets in anticipation of World War II. Long received a contract and the program’s success led to a second contract, for a school at the reactivated Hicks Field in Fort Worth and for an airplane mechanics training school at Love Field. Long opened another school at Curtis Field in Brady in March 1941. England also sent its Royal Air Force (RAF) cadets to train in the U. S., contracting with Long to open the No. 1 British Flying Training School at Terrell. During the war, Long and associates acquired Essair Airlines which provided airmail service from Houston to Amarillo, with stops across Texas. Renamed Pioneer Airlines in 1946, the carrier attested long’s belief that such feeder airlines would promote passenger flights when it expanded to dozens of cities in Texas and New Mexico. Under significant pressures of time and wartime shortages, Long operated four schools, training about one-tenth of U. S. Army aviators and one-third of RAF cadets in the U. S. His accomplishments garnered him honors from President Harry S. Truman and King George VI, as well as a place in Texas aviation history. Image source: terrellairport.com]]></description>

Fleming, who was killed in France during World War I. One of the best known organizations in Kimble County, the post sponsored such activities as charity functions, sporting events, celebrations, and conventions. In 1938 the Legion post built its own home of native rock on this site, embedding the interior walls with wartime memorabilia. A new memorial hall was erected following World War II, though the "Legion hut" continued to be used extensively. In 1966 the Legion granted the use of the hut to the county historical museum.

Joseph Dorst Patch, acting under orders of the United States Army during the troubles on the Mexican border. This camp served as the operational base for companies K, L and M of the 26th Infantry, U.S. Army. These units were detailed to defend the Armstrong, Kenedy and King ranches and the rail line from San Antonio to Norias against raids by Mexican insurgents striking north of the Rio Grande. Early in 1917, this camp was visited by the U.S. border commander, Gen. John J. Pershing, who later that year chose men of the 26th Infantry to become a vanguard regiment of the now famous First Division, American Expeditionary Forces in World War I. With departure of the chosen troops, bound for France, Camp Kingsville was closed.<br><br>Joseph Dorst Patch, born December 8, 1885, at Fort Huachuca, Ariz., enlisted in 1909 and was commissioned in 1911. He married Minerva King of Agua Dulce. He served in two world wars, and was awarded the Purple Heart, the Distinguished Service Cross, the Croix de Guerre with Bronze Star, and the Order of the Bath (British). Retired in 1945 as a major general, he turned to writing as a vocation. His home was in Corpus Christi, where he died November 21, 1966.<br><br>Incise on back: Plaque dedicated to Memory of Joseph Dorst Patch, Major general, U.S. Army,... soldier, humanitarian, patriot.

He was reared in Kerens and attended military school in North Carolina, graduating in 1900. He attended the University of Texas at Austin, but left in 1904 when a boll weevil infestation in Navarro County destroyed his family's cotton crop and their finances were diminished.Daniel worked at the First National Bank of Kerens and married Nellie Mae Hines of Tyler. Widowed in 1907, he married Jessie Mae Johnson of Corsicana in 1911. By 1913 he was a partner in the insurance firm of Daniel & Stockton. He joined the Texas National Guard and became mayor of Kerens. He was reelected twice and resigned in 1916 to go on active duty for the National Guard. He was called up to the U. S. Army in its operations in west Texas in pursuit of the Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa. During World War I he served in the army's 36th Division and was discharged as a captain. Joe Daniel went to work for the Lone Star Gas Company about 1929. He moved to Abilene in 1931, and to Corsicana in 1937. During and after World War II Daniel served in the Texas State Guard, retiring in 1954 with the rank of colonel. Daniel assisted Gov. Beauford Jester of Corsicana in creating the Veterans Affairs Commission in 1947. As its first chairman, he led the commission in providing valuable services to more than one million Texas veterans. Joe and Jessie Daniel returned to Kerens in 1952, shortly after his retirement from business, and his Veterans Commission term ended in 1953. Daniel served Kerens and Navarro County in a variety of civic, economic and historic preservation activities. (2000) Image source: rootsweb.ancestry.com]]></description>

Incorporated into the existing Spohn Park, part of the Broadway Bluff improvements completed in 1916, this court was the first of its kind in the state when dedicated on March 22, 1931.<br> The court was a project of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR), led by Mrs. Sam (Lillie) Rankin, regent of the Corpus Christi Chapter. The DAR was joined by the American Legion, as well as local civic, religious and business groups. The Gold Star Court was designed by Mrs. Frank de Garmo. Instrumental in establishing Courts of Honor in northeast cities, de Garmo envisioned the memorial as a living space to honor the fallen servicemen who made the ultimate sacrifice in the ‘War to End All Wars.’ the city planted crepe myrtle trees and built a gold star light, three feet in diameter, outlined with yellow and white lamps; in the center read the words, "Our 1917 World War Gold Star Heroes." the gold star was located at the northern point of the highest terraces, and at the opposite end, Nueces County officials placed a magnificent flagpole. On August 2, 1932, a British 5-inch field piece and a 3-inch caisson and limber were added to the site. Later, large concrete letters reading "World War Memorial Gold Star Court" were placed in a semicircle.<br> In 1988, Broadway Bluff, Spohn Park, and the gold star court were listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The site fell into disrepair until volunteers undertook a restoration project in 2000. A private, city, and county effort, the Gold Star Court — the first in Texas — honors Nueces County’s revered heroes and their mothers. Image source: waymarking.com]]></description>

Influenced by the VFW, congress established veterans benefits in 1917 that included disability compensation, vocational rehabilitation, and insurance. The VFW post in Aransas Pass was first chartered on January 29, 1935 by World War I veterans that included W.M. Womack, Worth B. Howard, C.R. Roberts, Olin Newberry, Normal D. Sanford, Albert Tate, and Rivas S. Olivares.<br> In 1945, donations were raised for the construction of veterans memorial home. The veterans memorial building has withstood hurricanes, served as a relief shelter, a disaster center, FEMA headquarters, and a Red Cross distribution center. Post membership has included veterans from World War I and II; current membership includes Vietnam, and Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. Each member is decorated with the Cross of Malta which is the official insignia of the order. District Six Command is in charge of the VFW organization, but VFW national headquarters and the Department of Texas VFW also offers guidance. The VFW Ladies Auxiliary has helped veterans with community activities and aids in conducting meetings. The John Wiebel VFW post is a historical organization in San Patricio County that has influenced county history by serving the veterans and the surrounding community.

Narrow strips of asphalt paving flanked streetcar tracks that ran the length of the avenue, then called Arlington Heights Boulevard. After the war, business and residential development spread into this area. In 1919 the street was renamed Camp Bowie Boulevard. In 1927-28, like many of the major thoroughfares in Ft. Worth, it was paved with durable Thurber bricks. Today this street is a reminder of Ft. Worth's heritage and a source of pride to area residents. (1979) Image source: hmdb.org]]></description>

Foreign troops trained in Texas during the winter and in Canada in the summer. Camp Taliaferro in Tarrant County, consisting of three air fields, provided training facilities for members of the Royal Flying Corps and U.S. forces from October 1917 to November 1918. Each field accommodated an average of 2,000 men. Royal Flying Corps expertise and skilled instructors enabled large numbers of Americans to receive excellent flight training in a short time.<br> During the months British and Canadian troops were stationed in Fort Worth, 39 officers and cadets were killed during flight training. Eleven of the men were buried at the three Air Fields; in 1924 the Imperial War Graves Commission purchased a plot at Greenwood Cemetery for reinterment. A monument was later erected at the site, which now has twelve graves since a veteran who died in 1975 requested burial here with his friends.<br> The Royal Flying Corps, although in Texas for only a short time, had a beneficial and lasting influence on aviation in this country.

At peak, 60,000 men were in training here. Named for Private David B. Barkeley of the 89th Division, who died on a secret scouting expedition behind German lines during the Meuse-Argonne Battle of World War I. Among famous units trained here were the 45th and 90th Infantry Divisions and the 11th and 12th Armored. A medical replacement training center, the largest in the country, was also established here, with 15 battalions. In May, 1942, the Medical Administrative Corps Officer Candidate School was activated and graduated about 12,500 candidates. Camp Barkeley eventually grew to be a complete city unit twice the size of Abilene of the 1940s. It had a 2,300-bed hospital, 2 cold storage plants, a bakery, 4 theaters, 2 service clubs for enlisted men, 15 chapels, and 35 post exchange buildings. The military personnel were housed in hutments, except for some 4,000 in barracks. Part of the post was also a German prisoner-of-war camp. Once some of the prisoners escaped, to the alarm of Abilene citizens, and others attempted to tunnel under the fences. Camp Barkeley was declared surplus in 1945.

Abilene Post No. 57 was organized on July fourth and chartered in September of that year, one of one hundred such chapters formed in the legion's first six months. Soon after its inception the post was renamed for James Harrison Parramore (1840-1917), one of Abilene's founders and a Civil War veteran who had been a supporter of the local National Guard.<br> The post's first structure was built of natural stone in 1920. The Ladies' Auxiliary was formed in 1922 and chartered in 1925. Legion facilities, expanded in 1937, housed the Ladies' Auxiliary and included what was for many years the only public swimming pool in Abilene.<br> In 1942, World War II veterans were admitted; veterans of the wars in Korea, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf later became members, as did veterans of other major military conflicts. The legion building was virtually destroyed by fire in 1980, eliminating the post's records.<br> The purpose of the American Legion is "to protect the interests of United States war veterans and their families." The legion has assisted veterans with employment, financial aid, medical care, and government benefits. The members celebrate Memorial Day and Veterans Day with parades and programs. The Parramore post also takes an active role in civic service, working with Abilene's youth and underprivileged citizens. Parramore Post No. 57 continues to uphold the traditions of its founders and remains an integral part of the Abilene community. (1998) Image source: hmdb.com]]></description>

As part of that duty, troops guarded railroad bridges along the border, including the High Bridge across the Pecos River and other strategic points. This task was important, as the tracks were a vital link for moving men and equipment between the Pacific Coast and the Gulf of Mexico during World War I. In 1920, the camp was renamed Camp Michie in honor of Brigadier General Robert Edward Lee Michie, who died in combat in France in 1918. The federal government officially closed the camp and surplused the property in 1923. (2006) Image source: vvchc.net]]></description>

The arrival of a plane in Del Rio was a major event then, but it became a common sight in later years. During World War I, the town was a center of aerial patrols along the United State-Mexico Border. In 1919 planes were dispatched to the area in reaction to Pancho Villa's border raids. One pilot stationed here to fly border patrols was Lt. James H. Doolittle, who later gained international attention in World War II. In the 1940s Del Rio was chosen as the site of an Air Base because of the flat terrain and the mild climate. Opened as the first B-26 bombardier school, Laughlin Air Force Base was named in honor of Lt. Jack T. Laughlin, the first pilot from Del Rio killed in action in World War II. Later a pilot training school, it closed after the war. In 1952, through the efforts of local residents, it was reopened. Laughlin has been utilized for Astronaut Training, Strategic Air Command U-2 reconnaissance missions, the development of Air Training Command's undergraduate pilot training mission, and other important innovations.

In 1940, as the nation faced another war, the city of Laredo hired local contractor H.B. Zachry to build an airport to replace the landing strip. The city named the airport Zachry Field in honor of H.B.’s father, U.S. Army colonel John Zachry.<br>In 1941, local leaders persuaded U.S. senator Morris Sheppard, chairman of the Senate Military Affairs Committee, to petition for a wartime training facility in Laredo. On May 7, 1942, the U.S. Military acquired Zachry Field, expanding the site to more than 2,085 acres, with an additional 685,000 acres of aerial target ranges northwest toward Eagle Pass ad 35,000 acres north of the city for ground target practice. In 1944, Laredo Army Air Field Flexible Gunnery School reached its peak capacity with more than 15,000 personnel and 250 aircraft. Airmen here trained in gunnery instruction and airplane and turret mechanics for medium and heavy bombers. While Women Air Force Service pilots flew engineering tests.<br>In late 1945, the field became inactive and the land transferred to the War Assets Administration. In 1952, during the Korean War, the site reactivated as Laredo Air Force Base, providing basic training for cadets from the U.S. Air Force and 24 North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries. The base continued in operation until 1973, when the military declared the facility excess and deactivated the command. The site reopened in 1975 as Laredo International Airport, continuing its long association with aviation history in the area. (2007) Image source: webcountytx.gov]]></description>

A third generation Texan, born here in Alvord. Left college to enter service in World War I, earning a battlefield commission as lieutenant colonel -at the time the youngest in American army. In 1930 gained national acclaim as crusading mayor of Amarillo. Appointed (1932) to Texas Railroad Commission, served by election until 1966. From prior career of lawyer-hotel owner, he stepped into public duty which sent him at once into East Texas during the world's greatest oil boom, to enforce probation. At peril of his life, he shut off non-complying wells and made the petroleum industry respect Texas laws. He became a pioneer in conservation practices. With prompting from President Franklin Roosevelt, he led in 1934 in founding of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission. In Paris in 1937, he represented the United States at the World Petroleum Congress. By presidential order he was returned to Texas by the army in World War II, to insure oil supplies for allied military forces. He was awarded American Petroleum Institute Gold Medal for distinguished achievement, in 1951. As an international authority on oil - a key to world trade - he had great influence on the course of history. Image source: tsl.texas.gov]]></description>

S. Army Signal Corps, landed at this field. Called Massengale Meadow at the time, the site's flat terrain proved conducive to the establishment of one of the first airports in Texas. It was used by military aircraft during World War I and was the home of the Royal Flying Circus and other barnstormers in the 1920s. Expanded and improved over the years, it remains a privately-maintained public use airport. (1988) Image source: flickr.com]]></description>

House, was born in a two-story frame house at this site. He attended the Houston Academy and later continued his education in Virginia and at Cornell University. E. M. House married Loulie Hunter in 1881, and they were the parents of two daughters. In 1885 the family moved to Austin, and House became involved in Democratic party politics. He was instrumental in the election of four Texas governors-- James S. Hogg, Charles A. Culberson, S. W. T. Lanham, and Joseph D. Sayers. House gained national political prominence in 1912 when he was instrumental in the nomination of Woodrow Wilson for president. House became a trusted advisor to President Wilson, participating in foreign policy negotiations during and after World War I. He played a major part in drafting the Fourteen Points, Wilson's plan for ending the war, and was a delegate to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. House died in New York in 1838 and was buried in Houston's Glenwood Cemetery. Known as Colonel House for many years, he is remembered as one of the most politically influential people of Texas and the United States, although he never held elective office.

Wallace, Camp Wallace was established as a training facility for military personnel during World War II. The U. S. government acquired more than 3,300 acres of land between the towns of Hitchcock and Alta Loma on State Highway 6 for placement of the facility.<br> Construction began in November 1940. Before the erection of structures, 17 miles of access roads were built, 29 miles of electrical lines were installed, and a 2.9-mile spur rail track from the main rail line were laid. The site contained a total of 399 structures. Some buildings were constructed at Galveston's Fort Crockett and transported to the site, including a cold storage depot, bakery, laundry, and morgue. The camp contained a medical facility, 161 barracks, and a service club.<br> By May 1941 the camp accommodated 10,250 people, including officers, enlisted personnel, and civilian staff. Training continued through World War II. The site also housed German prisoners of war. In April 1945, Camp Wallace was transferred to naval supervision, and later served as a distribution center releasing veterans back into civilian life. The site was used by the Red Cross in 1947 following the explosions at Texas City. The camp was declared surplus by the U. S. government in 1947. (1996) Image source: flickr.com]]></description>
